Semantic assets have been defined by link:https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/adms[ISA] firstly as "a collection of highly reusable metadata e.g., xml schemata, and generic data models", and secondly, as "reference data e.g., code lists, taxonomies, dictionaries, and vocabularies" which are used for e-Government system development".

All the semantic assets needed to implement ESPD electronic documents are organised in a link:{url-tree}[distribution package]. The content of this folder is organised as follows:
