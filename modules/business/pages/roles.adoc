Both a CA, who creates the ESPD Request document, and the various EO entities who respond to one or more lots specified by the CA and produce an ESPD Response document, would use an ESPD Service to fill out the parts specific to their role in the public procurement process.

This is a guide to who fills out what in the ESPD 

== The CA

The CA fills in the following sections:

=== Part 1 of the form 

Some fields in this section might be a national requirement for e.g., national tracking purposes.

* Information about the publication
* information about the procurer's identity
* Information about the publication procedure

==== Lots

A procurement is always defined in *Lots*, which are effectively a package of supply. Even if there is only one instance of supply, there is one lot. Lots can differ in content, quantity, time, and location of delivery e.g.:

* Lot 1: 2 tons/ product 1/ to Poland/ July
* Lot 2: 3.5 tons/ product 2/ to Germany/ September

However, the lots are usually of a related product and/ or under the same financial allocation for the CA's purposes.

=== Part 3 of the form: Exclusion Grounds

*EU-wide exclusion grounds apply to the complete procurement i.e., automatically to every lot.*

NOTE: EU mandated exclusion grounds are included automatically and the CA cannot remove any.

* National exclusion grounds

These are included at a national level in a country specific ESPD service. 

NOTE: The CA can decide which optional national exclusion grounds to include as per national law. Mandatory national exclusion grounds cannot be excluded.

=== Part 4 of the form: Selection Criteria

The CA decides, *per lot*, which selection criteria apply and ticks/ unticks the specific criteria.


=== Part 5 of the form: Reduction of Candidates

This is where the CA can indicate whether they have a specific objective and where they will apply criteria for the EO to prove non-discrimination or compliance with other rules, for eligibility for consideration to supply.

== Economic Operators

Economic Operators can have different roles

* Sole contractor
* Group member: leader 
* Group member: not leader
* Other Entity not relied on 
* Other Entity relied on 

Due to the complexity of which parts are required to be filled in by which entities, a table is provided below:
