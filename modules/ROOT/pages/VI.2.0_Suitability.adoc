==== Related information requirements

See formal requirements related to 'Suitability' criteria for the Self-contained ESPD in the http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=44367916[BIS 41 - European Single Procurement Document (Version 2.0.0)], and more specifically the requirement http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=44367916#tbr070-003[_tbr070-003_]

==== Differences between Regulated and Self-contained

. In the *REGULATED*, the CA is able to check the selection criteria regarding Suitability that apply to a particular procurement procedure, but cannot provide the particular information required to the EO for each criteria.

. In the *SELF-CONTAINED*, the CA is able to specify the name of the register or the organisation the EO must be part of, and the URL. Additionally, the CA can specify Lots.

. For both versions (*REGULATED* and *SELF-CONTAINED*), the category ''Suitability'' is split into covers two groups of different data structures with these classification codes:

** One data structure for two types of ''enrolments''(''Enrolment in a relevant professional register'' and ''Enrolment in a trade register''), and
** Another data structure for two suitabilities related to ''service contracts'' (''For service contracts: authorisation of particular organisation needed'' and
''For service contracts: membership of particular organisation needed'').
