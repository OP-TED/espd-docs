=== 2. *SELECTION CRITERIA*

The range of criteria related to the selection of Economic Operators is larger and more 
heterogeneous than the one related to the exclusion criteria. The figure below is intended to 
identify and list all the categories (branches in text boxes) and criteria 
(leaves in text without boxes):

[.text-center]
[[selection_criteria_taxonomy]]
.Selection criteria taxonomy

[.text-left]
Some groups or sub-groups of selection criteria share the same structure, while other have their 
own specific structure. Beware that, differently to the exclusion criteria, some selection 
criteria do not provide additional data when answering ''Yes'' to the criterion question. 
When this occurs the ''yes'' answer is ''the'' expected data. 
This is clearly illustrated for the selection suitability criteria in the next subsection below.
