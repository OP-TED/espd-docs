== Short Tag Name 

Tag Name is made of capital letters only.  

The first letter is the first letter of the first word.  

The second letter is either the first letter of the second word or any letter of the first word but its first letter, and so on.  

When we use a second letter from the same word, it is to avoid ambiguity with another existing tag name or acronym.  

Tags are also very useful for documentation purposes. They are like shortcuts to their initial very long name. 

The following table is describing the correspondence between "criterion element", "UBL element" and "Short Tag Name".

== Implicit Numbering 

There is no explicit numbering of criterion descriptive elements in the ESPD project.  

The numbering is rather implicit according to the position of the element in the description.  

The numbering increases for element of same type (Question Group, Question Subgroup, Question, Requirement Group, Requirement Subgroup, Requirement, Caption) at the same level. 

The implicit numbering is more often used for terminal structural elements (Question 1, Question 2, Requirement 1, Requirement 2, etc.).  

The following images are illustrating the use of both "short tag name" and "numbering" on ESPD Criterion samples.
