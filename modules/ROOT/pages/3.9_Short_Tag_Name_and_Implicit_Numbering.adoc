== Short Tag Name 

Tag Name is made of capital letters only.  

The first letter is the first letter of the first word.  

The second letter is either the first letter of the second word or any letter of the first word but its first letter, and so on.  

When we use a second letter from the same word, it is to avoid ambiguity with another existing tag name or acronym.  

Tags are also very useful for documentation purposes. They are like shortcuts to their initial very long name. 

////
The columns of the tables are to be interpreted as follows:

* Column 1: an ordinal number to sort sequentially the criteria
* Column 2: contains always the opening and closing tag for Criterion
* Column 24: *Element Code*; in the case of Criterion it contains the code that categorises the criterion in the taxonomy of exclusion and selection criteria (it maps to the taxonomy drawn in the online documentation and in the spread-sheet files "ESPD-criterion" in folder /codelists). For the rest of elements there are three types of codes
** ON*, meaning "process always" (e.g. show always or read and extract data always")
** ONTRUE, meaning "process this group only if the previous parent question (always an INDICATOR) has been answered affirmatively"
** ONFALSE, meaning "process this group only if the previous parent question (always an INDICATOR) has been answered negatively"

== Implicit Numbering 

There is no explicit numbering of criterion descriptive elements in the ESPD project.  

The numbering is rather implicit according to the position of the element in the description.  

The numbering increases for element of same type (Question Group, Question Subgroup, Question, Requirement Group, Requirement Subgroup, Requirement, Caption) at the same level. 

The implicit numbering is more often used for terminal structural elements (Question 1, Question 2, Requirement 1, Requirement 2, etc.).  

The following images are illustrating the use of both "short tag name" and "numbering" on ESPD Criterion samples.
