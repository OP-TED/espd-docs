The text and tables below (about the classes, properties and attributes of the ESPD-EDM model) make reference to code lists, which use is compulsory in many cases. 
These references provide links to the specific code lists therein referred to. The links allow for the downloading of a PDF file with the metadata about
the list and the values and descriptions of each code. 

Click on the links to download and examine the code list you are interested in.

The ESPD Service uses http://www.schematron.com/spec.html[Schematron] and the https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/codelist/[OASIS Genericode 1.0] specification for the validation 
of externalised codes. If you need the Genericode files you can download them altogether, jointly with the code lists PDF files, from this link:./code_lists/code_lists.zip[zip volume].
