= UBL-2.3 and TOOP Requirements

During the development of ESPD-EDM some requirements arose from TOOP related to the Evidence class. The aforementioned requirements that can be found in the following GitHub link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/issues/277[issue], are fully mappable to the UBL 2.3 Schema.
