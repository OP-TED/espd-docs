*Rule*: Use the value "2.2". Use also "OASIS-UBL-TC" for the schemeAgencyID attribute. 

|*cbc:CustomizationID*
|Identifier
|1
|Identifies a user-defined customization of UBL for a specific use.
|*Information Requirement*: 
http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.0-tbr070-001[_tbr070-001_]. 

*Rule*: For the ESPD we use the value “urn:www.cenbii.eu:transaction:biitrdm070:ver3.0”. Compulsory use of the value "CEN-BII" for the schemeAgencyID attribute. 

|*cbc:ProfileID*
|Identifier
|0..1
|An identification of the specification containing the total set of rules regarding semantic content, cardinalities and business rules to which the data contained in the instance document conforms. The identification may include the version of the specification as well as any customizations applied.
|*Information Requirement*: 
http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.0-tbr070-001[_tbr070-002_]. 

*Rule*: Use the value "41". Use also "CEN-BII" for the scheme AgencyID attribute. 

|*cbc:ID*
|Identifier
|1
|An identifier for this document, normally generated by the system that creates the ESPD document, or the organisation responsible for the document (e.g. the buyer, e.g. a contracting authority, or the supplier, e.g. an economic operator). An identifier for this document, normally generated by the system that creates the ESPD document, or the organisation responsible for the document (e.g. the buyer, e.g. a contracting authority, or the supplier, e.g. an economic operator). The identifier enables positive referencing the document instance for various purposes including referencing between transactions that are part of the same process.

|*Information Requirement*: 
http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.0-tbr070-002[_tbr070-002_].

*Rule*: It is a good practice to use the CopyIndicator component if the same document is forwarded several times to the same or to different destinations. Use it in combination with the UUID identifier: copies of an ESPD document should be identified with distinct UUIDs.
