In UBL Codes and identifiers are based on ebXML Core components (UBL conforms to http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-conformance-to-CCTS/v1.0/UBL-conformance-to-CCTS-v1.0.html[ebXML CCTS ISO/TS 15000-5:2005] currently maintained by UN/CEFACT).

One convenient characteristic of these two CCT elements (Codes and Identifiers) is that they use a rich set of attributes that allow to identify their pattern, the name of the list, the URI from where to obtain the list, the Agency that maintains the list, the version of the list, and other. 

UBL-2.2 CCT are defined in the file `CCTS_CCT_SchemaModule-2.2.xsd` (see folders `xsd/common` or `xsdrt/common` in the link:./dist/espd-edm-v02.00.00.zip[distribution package]).

The figure below shows the complete list of attributes for the CCT `CodeType` component.
