|*REQUIREMENT*| Compulsory use of the code list link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.1.0/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/ods/ESPD-CodeLists-V2.1.0.ods[`InsuranceType`] for the SELF-CONTAINED version of the ESPD.

==== Differences between Regulated and Self-contained

. In the *REGULATED* version it is the economic operator who provides data about one risk indemnity insurance;

. In the *SELF-CONTAINED* version the contracting authority can require one minimum amount for multiple insurances, each one of a different type (see the code list link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.1.0/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/ods/ESPD-CodeLists-V2.1.0.ods[`InsuranceType`]);

. In the *SELF-CONTAINED* version when the amount specified by the economic operator (EO) is lower than the minimum required, the EO will be able to indicate that the EO commits to obtain the minimum amount required (though it doesn't have it now).

. In the *SELF-CONTAINED* version, for the type of insurance "Employers (Compulsory) Liability Insurance" (and only for this type), the EO will also be able to indicate whether it is exempt or not.

. The *SELF-CONTAINED* is able to keep in the XML documents the national sub-criteria defined by the MS in e-Certis.

. For both versions, *REGULATED* and *SELF-CONTAINED* The only criterion defined under this data structure is classified with the code:
