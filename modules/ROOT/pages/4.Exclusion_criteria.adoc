As suggested in section "Criteria Data Structures" criteria may be grouped in several different categories. The figure below is intended to identify and list these categories for the Exclusion criteria (branches in text boxes), and specific subgroups within each category (leaves in text without boxes).

Each branch in this 'criteria classification' corresponds to one data structure that is identical for all the leaves under that branch.
