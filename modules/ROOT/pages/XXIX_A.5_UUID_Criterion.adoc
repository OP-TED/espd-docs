=== UUID Criterion Validation

Each Criterion is defined in e-Certis and must use the *Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)* supplied by e-Certis:

. These UUIDs are 'constant', meaning that they are maintained by DG GROW and need to be used compulsory as they were issued by DG GROW.
. The value of each UUID are defined in the spreadsheets:
.. link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/blob/2.1.0/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/xlsx/ESPD-CriteriaTaxonomy-REGULATED-V2.1.0.xlsx[Criteria Taxonomy (Regulated ESPD)]
.. https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/blob/2.1.0/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/xlsx/ESPD-CriteriaTaxonomy-SELFCONTAINED-V2.1.0.xlsx(Self-contained ESPD)]

ESPD validates that the UUID defined in the ESPDRequest XML or ESPDResponse XML are the ones supplied by e-Certis:
|=== 
| *Spreadsheet row* | *XSD Path*
| {CRITERION | cac:TenderingCriterion/cbc:ID
| {QUESTION_GROUP | cac:TenderingCriterion/cac:TenderingCriterionPropertyGroup/cbc:ID
| {QUESTION_SUBGROUP | cac:SubsidiaryTenderingCriterionPropertyGroup/cbc:ID
|===

Every QUESTION_GROUP and QUESTION_SUBGROUP that has the same structure (meaning, QUESTION or QUESTION_SUBGROUP), share the same UUID, as they are the same.


==== Tendering Criterion

The validation of each criterion (cac:TenderingCriterion element) has the aim to check:

. cbc:ID, cbc:CriterionTypeCode, cbc:Name and cbc:Description are mandatory;
. cbc:ID and cbc:CriterionTypeCode values match with the ones supplied by e-Certis;
. cac:TenderingCriterionPropertyGroup structure matches with the QUESTION_GROUP supplied by e-Certis (see Tendering Criterion Property Group and Subgroup section).


==== Tendering Criterion Property Group and Subgroup

The same validations are executed for the first level group of properties and sub-groups of properties. The rules applied are:

. The cbc:ID and cbc:PropertyGroupTypeCode are mandatory elements and their values are the ones supplied by e-Certis in the corresponding cbc:TenderingCriterion;
. cac:TenderingCriterionProperty structure matches with QUESTION supplied by e-Certis (see Tendering Crtierion Property section);
. cac:SubsidiaryTenderingCriterionPropertyGroup matches with QUESTION_SUBGROUP supplied by e-Certis (for each property group, the same validations are applied).


==== Tendering Criterion Property
The validation of Tendering Criterion Property (cac:TenderingCriterionProperty element) is checked as follows:

. cbc:TypeCode and cbc:ValueDataTypeCode are mandatory elements and match with the ones supplied by e-Certis;
. cbc:ID and cbc:Description elements are mandatory, although their values are not validated;
. If cbc:TypeCode value is "CAPTION" or "REQUIREMENT", cbc:ValueDataTypeCode value must be "NONE".
