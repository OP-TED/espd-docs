=== Criterion

Criteria are at the core of the ESPD. The two main groups of Criteria relevant for the ESPD are the ones 
required in the Directive, Exclusion and Selection criteria. This section gives a detailed view on how 
to specify each of those criteria. Its content is aligned to the http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0007[Annex to the Regulation 2016/7] 
establishing the standard form for the European Single Procurement Document.     

Additionally to the Exclusion and Selection Criteria, the ESPD EDM treat some data related to the
Economic Operator also as criteria. This is covered further on under Section "Other Criteria".

==== Core Criterion and Core Evidence Data Models and Vocabularies

This document differentiates between _Data Model_ (referring to the UML conceptual diagrams) and 
_Vocabulary_ (referring to the XSD schemas). Thus the CCV and CEV abbreviations refer to the 
Core Criterion and Core Evidence XSD Schemata that implement the conceptual 
Data Models (represented as UML diagrams). 

The UML diagram below shows in detail the classes of the Core Criterion and Core 
Evidence Data Models used in the ESPDResponse XML document.

As far as the ESPD Service is concerned the above UML diagram SHOULD be interpreted as follows:

* One Criterion contains one or more Groups of Requirements
* One Criterion MAY have sub-Criteria 
* One Criterion MAY be linked to a specific Legislation
* One Group of Requirements contains one or More Requirements
* One or more Response MUST be provided (by the EO) for each Requirement
* The Response MUST be of one, and +++<u>only one</u>+++, type of data
* The type of data in a Response can be either an Indicator (a boolean value), a Code (representing a concept), an Amount (an economic value expressed as a specific currency type), a Date, a Percent, a Quantity or a Period  
* One Response MAY refer to one or more Evidences
* The Response MAY also refer to a Party that is somehow related to the Response  
* An Evidence MAY refer to the issuer of that Evidence
* The Evidence MAY refer to an attached DocumentReference, i.e. to a URL pointing at a document; the document could also be embedded into the cev:Evidence element, although the ESPD Service does not use this UBL feature  

 
In the ESPD documents a +++<u>Criterion</u>+++ takes the form of a ''question or statement about a specific subject that may lead to the exclusion or selection of an Economic Operator in a 
Procurement Project''. An example of Criterion in the ESPD would be a question like this:

[.text-center] 
"_Has the economic operator itself or any person who is a member of its administrative, management or 
supervisory body or has powers of representation, decision or control therein been the subject of 
a conviction by final judgement for participation in a criminal organisation, by a conviction rendered 
at the most five years ago or in which an exclusion period set out directly in the conviction 
continues to be applicable?_"

[.text-left]
''+++<u>Requirements</u>+++'', in turn, relates to the way the Economic Operator has to answer one 
specific Criterion. In the case of the exclusion Criterion above mentioned, the Contracting 
Authority requires the Economic Operator (EO) to answer ''yes or no'', and in the case of an 
affirmative answer the EO is required to provide some more specific data about the 
conviction.

[IMPORTANT]
In principle, practically all the elements in the UML class and the XSD Schema are optional.
However *this does not mean that an ESPD conformant Service will accept that 
certain data are not provided (or all of them for that matter)*. The compulsoriness of the ESPD Service documents 
elements is not controlled solely by the XSD Schema. Instead the cardinality of the elements is also validated based on ''rules''. 
These rules are assertions about the restrictions that affect an element,  an attribute or the 
relationship between classes.footnote:[The ESPD Service confirms the presence of an element that in the schema is optional using the ISO Schematron validation method. The reason why the cardinality of the XSD schema is kept optional for most of the elements is to provide a model that is flexible enough so as to be used in other contexts different to the ESPD Service, e.g. for procurement projects at national or subnational levels where the value of the contracts are below the threshold; or for its use in systems where the ID of the instantiated objects is considered enough to identify a Criterion or a Requirement. For details about Schematron see http://www.schematron.com/spec.html.].
In the tables below, describing each class, the optionality or compulsoriness is indicated in respect of the ESPD Service needs, and
regardless of the XSD cardinality.

The next figure shows the "collapsed" (i.e. abbreviated) XSD Schema corresponding to the Criterion element:

The tables below list and describe each class of the Core Criterion Vocabulary and Core Evidence 
Vocabulary used in the ESPDResponse XML document. They also provide the rules specific to each 
class, properties and elements within the class, as mentioned above. When implementing XML instances 
of the ESPDRequest schema these rules MUST be thoroughly respected if the XML instance is intended 
to be ESPD Service-conformant.

Remember that the prefixes (ccv:, cbc: cac:, etc.) are representatives of the namespaces used in the 
XSD Schema (see "Table 1. Schemas, namespaces and prefixes used by the ESPDResponse").

[NOTE]
Except for the ccv:Response element, the rest of the data is already present in the ESPDRequest XML Document. The ESPDResponse copies the ESPDRequest and extends it with the Response of the EO.
