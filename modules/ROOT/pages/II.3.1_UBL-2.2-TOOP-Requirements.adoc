=== UBL-2.2 and TOOP Requirements

During the development of v2.1.1 some requirements arose from TOOP related to the Evidence class. The aforementioned requirements, that can be found in the following GitHub link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/issues/254[issue], are fully mappable to the UBL 2.2 Schema.
