|*REQUIREMENT* 
|*The contracting authority must be able to provide basic data about the Procurement Procedure*
|===

There are some important differences between the data collected for a Regulated ESPD Request and the data that can be required in a Self-contained ESPD Request.

==== Mock-up

For the Regulated ESDP REquest only three basic data are required: the title, a short description and the file (i.e. case) reference number attributed by the Contracting Authority to the procurement procedure.

The mock-up below shows a possible way of collecting this data:
