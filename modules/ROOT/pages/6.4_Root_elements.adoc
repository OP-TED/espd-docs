|===
|*Document name:* |*QualificationApplicationResponse*
|*Definition*: a|
"_A structured electronic business document for providing qualification information in a simplified way through an ESPD when responding to a Call for Tender._" (source: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1-tbr92-020[_ESPD Response transaction (Trdm092)_]).

Preliminary evidence certificates in the form of a self-declaration submitted by the economic operator during the tendering phase. On awarding, the winning party has to supply the real attestations and certificates.

|*Components* |*Type* |*Card* |*Description* |*Requirements*
|*cbc:UBLVersionID* |Identifier |1 |Identifies the earliest version of the UBL 2 schema for this document type that defines all of the elements that might be encountered in the current instance. a|
*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1-tbr92-020[_tbr92-020_].

*Rule*: Use the value "2.3". Use also "OASIS-UBL-TC" for the schemeAgencyID attribute.

*Rule scope*: Common (BR-OTH-05, 2.BR-OTH-02)

|*cbc:ProfileExecutionID* |Identifier |1 |The identification and version of the ESPD Exchange Data Model used to create the XML instance. The identification may include the exact version of the specification. a|
*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1-tbr70-002[_tbr070-002_].

*Rule*: Compulsory use of the CodeList ProfileExecutionID. Use the value "OP" for th SchemeAgencyID attribute.

*Rule scope*: Common (BR-OTH-01, BR-OTH-01#13, BR-OTH-03)

|*cbc:ID* |Identifier |1 |An identifier for this document, normally generated by the system that creates the ESPD document, or the organisation responsible for the document (e.g. the buyer, or the supplier, e.g. an economic operator). The identifier enables positive referencing the document instance for various purposes including referencing between transactions that are part of the same process. a|
*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1-tbr92-020[_tbr92-019_].

*Rule*: Compulsory use of schemeAgencyID attribute. Use it to identify the organisation responsible for the document.

*Rule scope*: Common (BR-OTH-02)

|*cbc:CopyIndicator* |Indicator |0..1 |Indicates whether this document is a copy (true) or not (false). a|
*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1-tbr92-020[_tbr92-019_].

*Rule*: It is a good practice to use the CopyIndicator component if the same document is forwarded several times to the same or to different destinations. Use it in combination with the UUID identifier: copies of an ESPD document should be identified with distinct UUIDs.

|*cbc:UUID* |Identifier |1 |A universally unique identifier that can be used to reference this ESPD document instance. a|
*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1-tbr92-020[_tbr92-019_].

*Rule*: Other documents, e.g. the tender, might refer to the ESPD Response using this identifier (thus its compulsoriness). Copies of a document must be identified with a different UUID. Compulsory use of schemeAgencyID attribute.

|*cbc:ContractFolderID* |Identifier |1 |An identifier that is specified by the buyer and used as a reference number for all documents in the procurement process. It is also known as procurement project identifier, procurement reference number or contract folder identifier. A reference to the procurement procedure to which a Qualification request document and the delivered response documents are associated. a|
*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1-tbr92-020[_tbr92-013_].

*Rule*: Try always to use the reference number issued by the buyer. This number in combination with a registered buyer ID (e.g. the VAT number) results in a *universally unique identifier of the procurement procedure*.

*Rule scope*: (BR-SC-30)

|*cbc:IssueDate* |Date |1 |Date when the document was issued by the buyer. a|
*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1-tbr92-020[_tbr92-019_].

*Rule*: Format "YYYY-MM-DD".

|*cbc:IssueTime* |Time |0..1 |Time when the document was issued by the buyer. a|
*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1-tbr92-020[_tbr92-019_].

*Rule*: Format "hh:mm:ss".

|*cbc:EconomicOperatorGroupName* |Text |0..1 |The name of the group that presents a tender to which this economic operator belongs (e.g. the name of a consortium, a joint venture, etc.). a|
*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1-tbr92-020[_tbr92-008_].

*Rule*: The leader of the group must take care of ensuring that the name of the group is identical in all the ESPDs of the tender.

*Rule scope*: (BR-LEAD-10-S10)

|*cbc:VersionID* |Identifier |0..1 |The version identifying the content of this document. a|
*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1-tbr92-020[_tbr92-020_].

*Rule*: Changes in content should entail the modification of the version identifier and a reference to the previous version.

|*cbc:PreviousVersionID* |Identifier |0..1 |The version identifying the previous modification of the content of this document. a|
*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1-tbr92-020[_tbr92-020_].

*Rule*: None

|*cbc:ProcedureCode* |Code |1 |The type of the procurement administrative procedure according to the EU Directives. a|
*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1-tbr92-020[_tbr070-007_].

*Rule*: For the ESPD, this information will be linked to eForms. And ESPD should include the same procedure code as the one stated in eForms notices.

|*cac:ContractingParty* |Associated class |1 |The buyer or contracting entity who is buying supplies, services or public works using a tendering procedure as described in the applicable directive (Directives 2014/24/EU, 2014/25/EU).

*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1-tbr92-020[_tbr92-011_].

*Rule*: UBL-2.3 defines multiple cardinality ContractingParties presumably to allow *joint procurements*. However the ESPD only expects data about one buyer. The decision was made that in case of joint procurement the data collected in the ESPD would be about *the leader* of the joint procurement procedure.

*Rules*: At least two instances of the AdditionalDocumentReference are expected:
