For the time being, this general category refers to only the criterion ''Certificates by independent bodies about 
environmental management systems or standards''. The data-structure for this criterion in the ESPD Service is the one below (notice
that this structure is possibly on of the most frequent in the ESPD Service as it is used in several exclusion and selection criteria).
