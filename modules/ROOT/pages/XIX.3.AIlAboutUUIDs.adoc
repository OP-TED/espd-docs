=== IX.3 All about UUIDs


In the Regulated and Self-contained
link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.1.0/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/xlsx[ESPD-EDM Criteria Taxonomies]
every element of the criterion data structures has an UUID assigned, except for the CAPTIONs, REQUIREMENT(s) and
QUESTION(s).

This UUID is necessary to identify unambiguously a particular "data structure" (or "data shape"). One data
structure identified with a unique identifier has always the same elements and in the same order.
This allows *_the reuse_* of the same structure multiple times in the same criterion or in different criteria.
These UUIDs map the ones maintained in link:https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/solutions/e-certis_en[e-Certis] for each criterion.

==== Examples of data structure reuse

* *Example 1*: There is a data structure that is reused by practically  all the criteria, the one asking whether the information
is available electronically. You will notice that all criteria where it is used the UUIDs of the groups and
subgroups are identical, but also the cardinalities, the PropertyDataType and the Element Code.

* *Example 2*: If you look into the "Convictions" data structures you will notice a data structure
(a QUESTION_SUBGROUP) identified with the UUID "f4978772-3126-4ded-bc30-f50da8c3a038".
This subgroup contains one QUESTION ("Have you taken measures to demonstrate your reliability (Self-Cleaning)?"
and a sub-group with another QUESTION ("Please describe them").
If you search into the spread-sheet book you will observe that this very structure is also reused by other criteria
(e.g. CRITERION.EXCLUSION.SOCIAL.\*, CRITERION.EXCLUSION.MISCONDUCT.\*, etc.), but the UUID of the main subgroup is
different in all those cases from the one used for Convictions. This is because the Element Code in the case of
Convictions (and for this subgroup) is "ONTRUE" whilst in the rest of criteria it is "ON*".

As mentioned above, CAPTIONs, REQUIREMENT(s) and QUESTION(s) cannot have a *_reusable_* UUID pre-allocated.
The reason for this is that each response by the economic operator (in the ESPD Response document) MUST refer to one,
and only one, QUESTION of the ESPD Request. See other details on criterion properties in sections
link:#iv-4-properties[IV.4 Properties] and link:#viii-7-answering-questions[VIII.7 Answering QUESTION(s)].

==== Implementation challenge

The fact that Criterion Properties are to be generated dynamically may pose a challenge to developers in certain
situations. One of these situations could be when the QUESTIONs are repositoried and answered in a
Pre-Qualification System (PQS) that is used to pre-fill ESPD-Responses to ESPD-Request instances that are
kept in another system unknown to the PQS (e.g. a Service Provider acting on behalf of one or more Contracting
Authorities).

One possible solution may be based on the fact that **_each REQUIREMENT and QUESTION occurs always in the same
position inside a group or a sub-group_**. If the order of the REQUIREMENTs and QUESTIONs is altered the
Schematron-based validation would trigger a fatal exception.

The proposal consists in identifying each REQUIREMENT and QUESTION by concatenating the UUIDs of the CRITERION and the
"parent" groups and sub-groups, **_as described in the Criteria Taxonomy spread-sheets_**, produce a short hash of the
concatenated string and add to it the position of the element in the group or subgroup.
This casts a *constant* UUID for each REQUIREMENT and QUESTION that would be known by *_any_* stakeholder, thus
enabling the decoupling of systems producing ESPD-Requests and systems keeping particular QUESTIONS and RESPONSES.

Let's take one *_REGULATED_* criterion as an example to illustrate this proposal (this works also for *_SELF-CONTAINED
ESPD_* criteria):

==== Example: Convictions Criterion

===== User Story

_I, as a PQS, need to provide the information about an EO's convictions, so the  EO can produce a pre-filled ESPD-Response_.

===== Algorithm

The algorithm to generate the first subgroup of QUESTIONs (in convictions) would be:

1. Question_UUID = "" ;
2. Question_UUID += Criterion_UUID + "." ;
3. Question_UUID += Group_UUID + "." ;
4. Question_UUID += Subgroup_UUID + "." ;
5. Question_UUID  = hash_md5(Question_UUID) ;
6. Question_UUID += Question_UUID + "." + Group_Position() + "." + Subgroup_Position() + "." + Question_Position() ;

Apply repeatedly this algorithm to the subsequent sub-subgroups.

The objective of hashing the concatenation of UUIDs is to produce a non-too-verbose UUID for the QUESTION.

This algorithm produces a unique digital print per each data element of the _data shape_. If this hash were added to
an IRI, the data element could be described in a very specific namespace and its de-referencing could provide
back a machine-readable description of the element (name, description, examples, etc.).

===== Data Structure

The figure below would represent how the criterion "Participation in a criminal organisation would look like in the
Criteria Taxonomy if you applied the algorithm above:
