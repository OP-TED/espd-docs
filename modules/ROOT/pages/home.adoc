## Introduction
Article 59 of the new link:https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32014L0024[Public Procurement Directive 2014/24/EC] introduced a new concept, the **European Single Procurement Document** (ESPD) which is a self-declaration document intended for preliminary evidence in a public procurement procedure. By mapping out equivalent certificates between Member States, the ESPD replaces certificates issued by public authorities or a third party involved in a procedure. It is thus a valuable facilitator for cross-border participation of a greater number of potential operators in public procurement procedures and a valuable tool for integrating the European Single Market.

The European Commission (EC) has developed a data model and 'semantic assets' for the exchange of the ESPD between any Procurement stakeholderâ€™s system. This Wiki aims to be a first landing point for organisations interested in using the model and assets in compliance with the Directive.
