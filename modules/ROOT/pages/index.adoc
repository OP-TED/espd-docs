The European Single Procurement Document (ESPD) is a mandatory electronic form, in two parts, used by buyers to assess the suitability of suppliers tendering in a public procurement procedure. 

The documentation provided here explains the ESPD Exchange Data Model (ESPD-EDM) and covers the resources provided by the Publications Office, to help member states and commercial entities create an ESPD service. The service is the electronic online form which enables both parties in a procurement procedure to manage eligibility of a supplier in a procurement process.

The following information is provided for both business users (an overview of the ESPD), and technical users (resources for technical implementation of an ESPD Service).
