= ESPD Request cardinalities
include::partial$attributes.adoc[]

As you can see the UBL-2.3 Schema is quite flexible as, except for a few cases practically all the elements are optional.

The ESPD-EDM model, however, adds a few more restrictions regarding the cardinalities of some elements. These can be seen in the diagram below, which presents the ESPD-EDM structure for the ESPD Request with its own cardinality restrictions.

If you compare both figures you will observe that:

[arabic]
. The cardinalities of the root common basic components, such as cbc:ID, cbc:UUID,  are different for the ESPD than for UBL-2.3;
. Similarly, the cardinalities of aggregate components like cac:ContractingParty and cac:TenderingCriterion are different to the UBL-2.3 ones.

The cardinality constraints added by the ESPD are not defined in the XSD Schema. In order to control these constraints the ESPD-EDM uses link:https://schematron.com/[ISO Schematron] assertions. The ESPD-EDM distribution package provides Schematron schemata and CVA files for the validation of the XML instances (folder link:{url-tree-tmp}/validation[_/validation_]).
