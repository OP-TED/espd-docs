=== II.1 ESPD Distribution package

All the semantic assets needed to implement ESPD electronic documents are organised in a link:./dist[distribution package]. The content of this folder is organised as follows:

.Distribution (dist) package
image::Dist-structure.png[dist package, alt="dist package", width="150" align="center"]

. *art*: contains graphical resources used to  document the distribution;
. *cl*: reference data (codelists) used by the XML instances. It also contains a spread-sheet with all the ESPD criteria structured. This spread-sheet can be used to automatically generate ESPD XML instances.
. *doc*: contains this document (and other documents to support developers);
. *mod*: UBL-2.2 model specified in spread-sheets;
. *val*: validation artefacts (eg. ISO Schematron and OASIS Genericode CVA files);
. *xml*: samples of ESPD XML instances for illustrative and testing purposes;
. *xsd*: the UBL-2.2 XSD Schemas, documented (annotated) version;
. *xsdrt*: the UBL-2.2 XSD Schemas, runtime version;
. *xslt*: transformation stylesheets used to generate basic sample XML instances from the criteria defined in spreadsheets link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.0.2/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/ods/ESPD-CriteriaTaxonomy-REGULATED-V2.0.2.ods[*REGULATED* ESPD data structures] and link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.0.2/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/ods/ESPD-CriteriaTaxonomy-SELFCONTAINED-V2.0.2.ods[*SELF-CONTAINED* ESPD data structures] (see folder link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.0.2/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl[dist/cl]).
