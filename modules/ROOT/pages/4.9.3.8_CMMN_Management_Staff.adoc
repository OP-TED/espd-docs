==== Management

This general category groups the two criteria ''Number of managerial staff'', and ''Average annual manpower''. The two criteria have a 
repetitive structure (like in the case of ''references'') where groups of couples (Year, Number) are requested (number of staff and the 
year to which that year refers to). The quantity of groups is usually specified in the contract documents. The figure below is a fragment 
of a long table plenty of details. The corresponding data-structure diagram would be this one:
