_Table 29. Information requirement about the ESPD Response and the economic operators_ 
|===
|*REQUIREMENT* a|
*One ESPD Response per economic operator*. The ESPD-EDM-3.0.0, as all the previous versions of the ESPD, requires that every economic operator that participates in one tender provide its own ESDP Response document. This affects sole traders that rely on other entities for the execution of the contract (e.g. subcontractors) and groups of economic operators, e.g. a Joint Venture or a Consortium, and all the sub-contractors on which each economic operator of the group relies on to meet the selection criteria.

Moreover, each EO should submit an ESPD Response per lot or group of Lots which tenders to.

_Table 30. Information requirement about the identifiers of the economic operators_
|===
|*REQUIREMENT* |For the identification of the economic operators the UBL-2.3 element cac:PartyIdentification/cbc:ID must be used. The following two attributes of the cbc:ID element (CCT IdentifierType element) must be used: (1) @schemeID, a code from the Code List link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/3.0.0/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/ods/[EOIDType] must be used; (2) @schemeAgencyID, the default value "EU-COM-GROW" must be used; (3) Optionally, the attribute @schemeName can be used to place the 'Name' of the code (see the column 'Name' in the above mentioned Code List). For the ESPD-EDM the preferred type code for the @schemID is VAT.

_About the definition of economic operator_

*Beware* that this ESPD-EDM V3.0.0 specification defines economic operator based on the one provided by the 2014 Directives, where an economic operator is "any natural or legal person or public entity, including any temporary association of undertakings, which offers the execution of works and/or a work, the supply of products or the provision of services on the market. Information about the party submitting the qualification".

According to this definition one group of suppliers associated in a Joint Venture or in a Consortium, or any other type of undertaking is also an economic operator.

However, due to the previous requirement establishing that each company participating in a tender must prepare its own ESPD Response document, the ESPD-EDM specification never uses the term "economic operator" to refer to a group of persons and/or companies but *only to refer to each natural or legal person or public entity that participates in a tender*.

Therefore, in the context of the ESPD the definition of economic operator has been rephrased as "any natural or legal person or public entity, including any temporary association of undertakings, which offers the execution of works and/or a work, the supply of products or the provision of services on the market. Information about the party submitting the qualification".
====

*A couple of examples*. According to the previous requirements:

* One tender submitted by a sole trader that relies on two sub-contractors will have to include three ESPD Requests, one for the sole trader and one per each of the sub-contracted entity.
* One tender submitted by a Consortium composed of three economic operators, two of which rely on two sub-contracted entities and the third one relies on five sub-contracted entities, will have to include 3 + 2 + 5 (ten) ESPD Requests.
* Note that both examples are made to represent who should provide an ESPD Response. But it is also worth to note that all the participants have to provide an ESPD per Lot to which tender.

The information that the economic operator (EO) has to provide is relatively abundant, especially if the EO is the lead entity of a group. UBL does provide a class cac:EconomicOperator with sufficient data elements to identify the economic operator, its role, its representatives, physical location, officially registered address and other.

As the whole ESDP-EDM V3.0.0 is based entirely on the UBL-2.3 XSD (W3C) Schemas, these schemas are to be used for ESPD.

Nonetheless some data requested in the ESPD are not modeled in UBL-2.3, namely those aiming at purposes going beyond the identification of the economic operator; e.g. data with statistical purposes; or to ensure the transparency of the procurement procedure; other.

Therefore in the ESPD-EDM-3.0.0, the information about the economic operator is spread in two different places:

[arabic]
. The UBL-2.3 *cac:EconomicOperatorParty* component; and
. In *criteria data structures*: following the solution adopted for Version ESPD-EDM V3.0.0, the ESPD-EDM V3.0.0 defines several criteria classified as CRITERION.OTHER.EO_DATA.* (where the * refers to different branches and leaves of a different structures about the economic operator (e.g. SHELTERED_WORKSHOP, TOGETHER_WITH_OTHERS, etc.). The XML instances use criteria components (UBL-2.3 cac:TenderingCriterion) to structure these data. The sub-sections below cover both.

==== XSD Schemas

cac:EconomicOperatorParty

The UBL-2.3 cac:EconomicOperatorParty has three common aggregate components, the XSD Schema looks like this:

image:Economic_Operator_overview.jpg[EconomicOperator overview,width=436,height=161]

_Figure 197. cac:EconomicOperatorParty XSD, global view_

[arabic]
. *cac:QualifyingParty*: is used to place data about the economic operator that is available from an official list, tenderer register or (pre)qualification system, such as official classification schemes, certificates, the number of employees, references used for the classification, etc.;
. *cac:EconomicOperatorRole*: use to place the role of the economic operator;
. *cac:Party*: used to place the data to identify the EO and its contact.

===== cac:QualifyingParty

The diagram below shows the XSD element that will hold the data required by the ESPD (see mock-up 1/7, too). Beware that:

* *Identification of the economic operator*: The Identifier assigned by the register or (pre)qualification system to the economic operator is placed in the element /cac:EconomicOperatorParty/cac:QualifyingParty/cac:Party/cac:PartyIdentification (more details on this below and in the XML example);
* *(Pre)qualification system*: The Identifier and name of the (pre)qualification system is captured from e-Certis. The only datum that is necessary to keep in the XML is the identifier of the system provided by e-Certis. This identifier will be used as the value for the attribute schemeAgencyID (always compulsory) of the element /cac:EconomicOperatorParty/cac:QualifyingParty/cac:Party/cac:PartyIdentification. This way:
** The (pre)qualification system is perfectly identified (and trusted, as it is registered in eCertis); and
** The economic operator, identified with the number used in that (pre)qualification system, is linked inequivocally to that (pre)qualification system.
* *References and classification*: The references linked to the classification of the EO are place in the component cac:QualifyingParty/cac:CompletedTask.
** For V3.0.0 of the ESPD the only expected data about the reference is a short description identifying the task as described in the (pre)qualification system. However if you take a look at this common aggregate component you will observe that it caters for other relevant data.
** Similarly, ESPD-EDM V3.0.0, does not expect a complex representation of possible (optional) classification schemes. However the component cac:BusinessClassificationScheme, associated to cac:QualifyingParty allows complex hierarchical classifications.
* *SME and number of employees*: The number of employees determine the classification of the company as Micro, Small, Medium or Large company. The cac:QualifyingParty component provides two place-holders that are used by this ESPD-EDM (see also mock-ups above) :
** *cac:QualifyingParty/cbc:EmployeeQuantity*, for the number of employees; and
** *cac:QualifyingParty/cac:Party/cbc:IndustryClassificationCode* to indicate whether the EO is a micro, small, medium or large company (or simply an SME). This code is defined in the Code List link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/3.0.0/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/ods/[economic-operator-size]. See also sections "Expected Elements" and "XML example" for more details.
* *Turnover*: For statistical purposes the ESPD-EDM asks this datum to reflect the financial capability of the economic operator (see mock-ups above). This datum is to be placed in cac:QualifyingParty/cac:FinancialCapability/ValueAmount.

image:Qualifying_Party.jpg[Qualifying Party,width=404,height=337]

_Figure 198. cac:QualifyingParty element, XSD_

===== cac:EconomicOperatorRole

The UBL-2.3 element for the role of the economic operator is quite straightforward and typical in UBL: it provides a pair *code + description* (see Code List link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/3.0.0/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/ods/[eo-role-type] for the codes and descriptions; see also the XML example below).

===== cac:Party

The XSD diagram below shows (in blue) the elements for which data are expected in the ESPD Response for the cac:Party element of the economic operator.

image:Party__economic party.jpg[The Party of the economic party,width=295,height=439]

_Figure 200. The Party of the economic party_

The figures below show the `cac:QualifyingParty` sub-components `cac:BusinessClassificationScheme` and `FinancialCapability`, and `cac:CompletedTask` in a bit more of detail. At present, the ESPD-EDM only uses one field, cbc:Description for the references and classifications and `cbc:Amount`for the Turnover.

UBL-2.3 provides a component to hold very specifically the data to identify the economic operator as it officially registered in a Business Register. This XSD diagram below shows the elements of this component cac:LegalEntityParty. This ESPD-EDM specification recommends to use it as an alternative (or supplementary) way to identify the economic party.

==== Expected elements

Please, remember that the elements cac:ContractingAuthority, cac:ProcurementProject, cac:ProcurementProjectLot, and cac:AdditionalDocumentReference are expected in the ESPD Request, too. However, for the sake of brevity, and as they are taken from the ESPD Request and 'copied' in the ESPD Response, they have not been re-explained in this section about the ESPD Response. Therefore for details on those elements please refer to the section *2. The ESPD Request document*.

[cols=",",options="header",]
[IMPORTANT]
====
*Remember* that if the economic operator belongs to a group (i.e. it is not a sole contractor), the element /cac:QualificationApplicationResponse/cbc:EconomicOperatorGroupName becomes *compulsory* and that *the spelling of the name must be identical for lead entity, all the members of the group and all the entities that participate in the procedure*.

[arabic]
. The value expected for the EO identifier is of type Identifier. For the identifier of the EO it is also required to specify the type of identifier, and a closed list of possible types is proposed. EOs must use one of the available values, but the preferred one is the VAT number. Beware that the data structure does not keep the type of the identifier. This is because the this type code is placed in the attribute @schemeID of the cac:ResponseValue/cbc:ResponseID element (and the @schemeAgencyID attribute must be set to the default EU-COM-GROW). See the information requirement about the identifiers of the economic operators at the beginning of the section. See also next sections about the responses, XSD schemas and XML example.

As you will see next, the information required about the economic operators varies depending on several factors:

[arabic]
. Is the economic operator a sole trader or does it belong to a group?
. If it belongs to a group, is the economic operator the leader of the group, a member or another entity (see the different types of 'roles' below);
. Does the economic operator rely on other entities to fulfill the selection criteria?
. Is the procurement procedure divided into lots?

One relevant aspect is the *Role* of the economic operator. The ESPD-EDM V3.0.0 defines five different roles for the EO. The information to be provided by each role varies depending on whether the EO is:

[arabic]
. *Sole tenderer / Group Leader*: Sole entity or, in case of Consortium, Joint Venture or other types of groups, the leader of the group. In this case:
* The sole contractor or leader will have to produce a complete ESDP;
* The sole contractor or leader will also have to identify the rest of the procurers (in the case of a group);
* The sole contractor or leader will have to identify the entities upon which it relies (and about those on which the entities it relies on rely).
* The sole contractor or leader will have to identify the entities upon which it does not relies.
* The sole contractor or leader will have to specify the subcontracted proportion of the group (in the selection criteria "Subcontracted Proportion" of the ESPD).
. *Group member*: Member (not leader) of the Consortium, Joint Venture or other type of group. In this case:
* The member of the group will have to produce a complete ESPD;
* The member of the group does not have to identify the rest of the procurers or entities.
. *Other entity (relied upon)*: Entity on which the main contractor, the group or another subcontractor relies in order to meet the selection criteria. In this case:
* The entity will have to produce an ESPD;
* The entity will not have have to identify the rest of the procurers or entities. Beware that an entity could have again another entity which it relies on or a a sub-contractor: in this case those entities and sub-contractors will have also to produce their own ESPD Response.
. *Subcontractor*: Entity on which the main contractor, the group or another subcontractor does not rely in order to meet the selection criteria. In this case:
* The entity will have to produce an ESPD, too;
* The entity does not have to provide information about the selection criteria;
* The entity does not have to provide information about the reduction of the number of qualified candidates.

===== The simplest case

The simplest case is when:

* The economic operator (EO) is a sole tenderer
* The EO does not rely on other entities
* The EO has to provide an ESPD Response per Lot that wishes to tender

*Notice the following*:

[arabic]
. *Sole contractor*. We know that the EO is a sole contractor when:
* The role specified is 'Sole contractor'; and
* The EO states that it does not participate together with others; and
* The EO states that it does not participate in a group;
. *Not an SME*. . The definition of what is an SME is provided in the link:http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32003H0361[EU recommendation 2003/361]. Notice that ESPD asks for the number of employees and turnover. This can be used by the software applications to validate the consistency of the data provided by the EO with the definition. By the way, these data are all placed in the cac:QualifyingParty element. See the XSD diagrams above the and the XML example below for details on the use of the cac:QualifyingParty and sub-components.

===== Sheltered workshop

If the economic operator answers *Yes* the fields about the 'percentage of disabled/disadvantaged workers and the category of handicap to which they belong to should shown, validated or processed.

*Data structure for a sheltered workshop or social business in case of reserved procurement*:

image:Sheltered_workshop_social_business.jpg[Sheltered workshop or social business,width=566,height=175]

_Figure 222. Sheltered workshop or social business - data structure_

===== EO registered in a (Pre)Qualification System (PQS)

One of the questions asked is whether the economic operator is registered on an official list (e.g. on a national Pre-Qualification System). In the case the EO answers *Yes*, the software application should ask the EO for this other data about which the evaluators may be interested in

Beware that the (pre)qualification system the EO is registered on must be know by the software application. One proposal is that each (pre)qualification systems is perfectly identified and registered in e-Certis so the applications can use it and trust it (and even download certificates from it). Note that This is part of the schema envisioned in the Once Only Principle. However if this were not possible (because e-Certis does not implement this timely, for example), the data structure for the PQS provides an alternative field to keep the name of the (pre)qualification system; see data structure below.

In case the EO is registered on several pre-qualification systems, the EO will need to choose the one that applies to this particular procurement procedure. The EO will also be required to provide the identification of the EO in the selected pre-qualification system.

*Data structure for the (pre)qualification of the economic operator by an official list or similar*:

* The identifier assigned by the (pre)qualification system to the economic operator is required. This value however is placed in the element cac:QualifyingParty/cac:Party/cac:PartyIdentification/cbc:ID and therefore is not required in the data structure.
* The name of an alternative or additional (pre)qualification system (PQS) can also be provided by the EO. In principle this is not necessary as the PQS identifier is the value of the attribute @schemeAgencyID of the element cbc:ID.

image:Pre-qualification_related_data_structure.jpg[Pre-qualification-related data structure,width=566,height=255]

_Figure 223. Pre-qualification-related data structure_

*Data structure to* identify *the rest of the EOs that are members of the group*:

In the ESPD the Group leader must identify the rest of economic operators that participate in the group. See the rest of the mock-ups and data structure below to see how, additionally, it also identifies other entities (e.g. sub-contractors).

Notice that:

[arabic]
. The values expected for the name and activity are texts.
. The value expected for the EO identifier is of type Identifier. For the identifier of the EO it is also required to specify the type of identifier, and a closed list of possible types is proposed (see Code List link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/3.0.0/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/ods/[EOIDType]. EOs must use one of the available codes, but the preferred one is the VAT number. Beware that the data structure does not keep the type of the identifier. This is because this type code is placed in the attribute @schemeName of the cac:ResponseValue/cbc:ResponseID element (and the @schemeAgencyID attribute must be set to the default EU-COM-GROW). See information requirements at the beginning of the section. See also next sections about the responses, XSD schemas and XML example.

==== Mock-up: Information about reliance on the capacities of the other entities

As explained above, the Sole tenderer or the Leader of a group will have to provide information about the entities it relies on in order to meet the selection criteria. The mock-up below shows the set of data the ESPD-EDM V3.0.0 expects from this role. Remember that this information does not need to be supplied by the members of a group or other entities.

_Figure 229. Relied on entities - data structure_

==== Mock-up: Information about third parties on which the EO does not rely on

The Sole contractor or the Leader of a group will have also to provide information about subcontractors on whose capacity the economic operator does not rely. Remember that this information does not need to be supplied by the members of a group or other entities.

. Role of the economic operator. The values are defined in the Code List link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/3.0.0/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/ods/[eo-role-type]. The selection of the value Sole Tenderer or Group Leader determines whether the data about the relied-on and not-relied-on entities is instantiated in this XML.
. Name of the economic operator. A text field.
. Street and number of the economic operator. Notice that the cac:AddressLine element is used instead of cbc:StreetnName and cbc:BuildingNumber. This is because name and number are not split in two fields.
. Postcode (zip code) of the EO. A text field. Either the GUI and/or an external Schematron rule could be implemented to control the pattern of this text.
. City, the name of the town of the EO. Applications could check whether the town exists in the country.
. Country, only the country code identifier is needed. In this example the description is also used, but is redundant. Software applications should be able to, based on the language of the user, retrieve the name of the country based on the country code.
. E-mail address of the EO. A text field. Either the GUI and/or an external Schematron rule could be implemented to control the pattern of this text.
. Telephone of the EO. A text field. Either the GUI and/or an external Schematron rule could be implemented to control the pattern of this text.
. A coma separated list of persons of contact.
. The VAT number of the EO. Notice how the attributes of the cbc:ID element are used: they respect the information requirements established for the identification of the EO (see requirements at the beginning of the section).
. Additional identifier. In this example it is not used, thus the absence of the element.
. Internet address, normally the official web-site of the EO.
. Code to identify the type of the company (micro, small, medium, SME, Large). Notice the use of the Code List economic-operator-size (for statistical purposes).
. Number of employees of the EO’s company. Do not use separators. The software application should take care of the formatting (for statistical purposes).
. Indicative turnover of the EO’s company (for statistical purposes).

==== 6.6.1 Economic operator representatives

==== Related information requirements

See formal requirements related to the representatives of the economic operator in the e-Sens site: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1-tbr092-021[_tbr92-021_].

*Notice that the economic operator may specify more than one representative*.

==== Mock-up

*In this example of mock-up the economic operator is specifying two representatives:*

image:EO_representatives_mock-up.jpg[EO representatives - mock-up, mock-up,width=543,height=522]

_Figure 233. EO representatives, mock-up_

==== XSD Schema

In the The ESPD-EDM V3.0.0 all the data regarding the representative of the economic operators is placed in the UBL-2.3 component cac:EconomicOperatorParty/cac:Party/cac:PowerOfAttorney. In principle the elements expected by the ESPD-EDM are very few, only the ones represented in the mock-up above. However this UBL element provides other possibilities that may be used in the future or for other purposes (or as a national extension of the ESPD).

Thus, additionally to the expected elements, the cac:PowerOfAttorney component caters also for, at least, two other data could be required at some point (e.g. cac:MandateDocumentReference, see figure below):

* The place of registration of the representative. The logic first element to look at is the place of birth (this is one of the expected elements). But other elements could be used complementarily: (i) cac:Person/cac:IdentityDocumentReference (A reference to a document that can precisely identify this person (e.g., a residence certificate), (ii) cac:Person/cbc:NationalityID, and/or cac:Person/cbc:CitizenshipCountry.
* Official documentation demonstrating that the person representing has an authentic mandate (e.g. a reference to a register where this mandate is located). For this the element cac:/PowerOfAttorney/cac:MandateDocumentReference should be used.

image:EO_representatives_Power_Attorney_XSD_Schema.jpg[EO representatives Power of Attorney, XSD Schema,width=498,height=328]

_Figure 234. EO representatives Power of Attorney, XSD Schema_

Notice that the largest part of the data is held in the component cac:EconomicOperatorParty/cac:Party/cac:PowerOfAttorney/cac:AgentParty/cac:Person. The figure below shows (in blue) the expected elements. See the table "Expecte Elements" and the XML example below for the details (e.g. how to use the cac:Person/cac:Contact element to contact the representative.
