== Summary OUC meeting on 1^st^ October 2024

* The link to the https://docs.ted.europa.eu/espd-wgm/monthly.html[main documents] related to the previous Open User Community (OUC) meeting was provided: in the index the user can navigate to the corresponding event, in this case 2024-10-01. Also, the links for https://docs.ted.europa.eu/espd-wgm/annual.html[Annual Seminars] and the last https://op.europa.eu/en/web/ted-together/agenda_2024_12_03[TED Together Event].
* The main topics discussed in October were summarized:
** Documentation – new UX Design.
** v4 presentation – online.
** ESPD Demo with interactive examples.
** GitHub status – closed tickets.

== Simplified visualisation in Enterprise Architect

* ESPD-EDM modelled in Enterprise Architect was presented:
** Alignment of ESPD-EDM with eCertis UUIDs and eForms code lists.
** Tools: Generate boilerplate for ESPD Service implementers.
* The team has responded to the question of whether the Enterprise Architect file can be accessed: yes, .eapx is available at https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/blob/v5.0.0-alpha.1/conceptual-model/ESPD_CM.eapx[GitHub].
* For ESPD-EDM espd-tools branch now is available:
** The export of EA structure into JSON format.
** JSON schema for ESPD-EDM.
* ESPD Demo is improved with:
** Integrated SurveyJS for ESPD online form.
** Integrated PDFMake to generate PDF documents.

== GitHub status

* There are 15 closed issued from the last meeting:
** Closed issues from the backlog, cleaned up in October 2024.
** Issues transferred to ePO (https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/issues/413[#413]) and eCertis (https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/issues/367[#367], https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/issues/356[#356], https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/issues/336[#336]) colleagues. More details in the next section from eCertis team.
** Two issues related to the future release: https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/issues/423[#423] (++[++Other++]++: Mapping the SubContractor to the Tenderer) and https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/issues/386[#386] (Can the evidence group or subgroup be dropped to follow the ESPD regulation?). Both of them were resolved and implemented in new release model (EA).
* There are 2 open issues:
** https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/issues/424[#424] (++[++Question++]++: Where could we find translations for SUBCRITERIONs descriptions) and https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/issues/422[#422] (Purely national Exclusion Ground - dynamic structure)
** Discussion is ongoing and probably we will have a new bilateral meeting with colleagues from Slovenia.

== eCertis Work Ongoing

* eCertis team presented work ongoing:
** UUID Management: Improved UUID handling for record updates and lifecycle that will resolve reported issues.
** New Criteria: Merging criteria for service contracts requiring authorisation or membership of particular organisations.
** GitLab: Similar working methods as eForms GitLab, including change requests, documents, and workshops.

== Next meetings

* The next OUC meeting is planned and confirmed for the 17^th^ of June 2025, 10:00 – 11:30.
* After this, the next OUC meeting is planned for the 2nd of October 2025.
