== Occupation code list (ESCO)

* A technical code list “Occupation” was included in ESPD v3.0.0 (April 2021), based on ESCO (Multilingualclassification of European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations), but since then ESCO has been updated.

* During June 2022, EU Vocabularies will provide the genericode file and a link to point to the ESCO website, which will be available in the next ESPD release and will replace the current one.

== UUID

* The definition and analysis of the proposed solution for the UUID is ongoing.

* An internal meeting was held with INTERPROC on the 7 June 2022 to discuss the overall approach and the details of the solution.

* Currently, request and response samples are being tested to validate the solution with regard to question groups containing variable cardinality.

* Requirements linked to Selection Criteria will be addressed after the question group solution is ensured.  Changing values of a requirement will have an effect on validation, therefore a suitable solution with regard to reusability needs to be found. 

* The goal is to include the changes in the UUID in a release during 2023 after validation by the OUC and the change management board.

== Documentation update

* Since the release of the v3.0.0 of the ESPD, online documentation can be updated without the need of a release.

* link:https://docs.ted.europa.eu/ESPD-EDM/3.0.1/index.html[Developer docs] provide information on how to use the artifacts available in GitHub. Technical artifacts only change with an ESPD release, but documentation can be improved without a release.

* In the link:https://docs.ted.europa.eu/espd-ouc/20220428_OUC%20meeting%20report.html[ESPD Exchange Data Model (ESPD-EDM) webpage], information is provided on the last update of each reviewed document. Within the document (in the example presented in the meeting, the Technical Handbook) a final section provides detailed information on the specific changes.

== GitHub issues

* The recently closed GitHub issues (4 issues) and the currently open issues (10 issues) are discussed.

* Issue link:https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/issues/334[#334], regarding the purely national Exclusion Grounds in ESPD-EDM v3.x.x, will not be solved within the next few months and require a change request on eCertis side. 

* Issue link:https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/issues/287[#287], regarding the request to add a new non-mandatory requirement, Subcontracting Proportion, within several selection criteria, is discussed. If no objections are received before mid July 2022, the requirement will be added in the next ESPD release.

== Next meetings

* *Next OUC meeting*: 29 September 2022, 10.00 – 11.30. #-> New date: 28 September 2022, 10.00 – 11.30#
