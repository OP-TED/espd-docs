|*Components*|*Type*|*Card*|*Description*|*Requirements*

|*cbc:ID*
|Identifier
|1
|Identifies a group of requirements uniquely.
|*Information Requirement*: 
http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.0-tbr070-013[_tbr070-013_]. 

*Rule*: Compulsory use of the UUIDs supplied by e-Certis. See also the spreadsheets link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.0.2/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/ods/ESPDRequest-CriteriaTaxonomy-REGULATED-V2.0.2.ods[_Criteria Taxonomy (Regulated ESPD)_] and link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.0.2/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/ods/ESPDRequest-CriteriaTaxonomy-SELFCONTAINED-V2.0.2.ods[_Criteria Taxonomy (Self-contained ESPD)_]. 

*Rule scope*: Common (BR-TC-12, BR-OTH-02, BR-OTH-02#01)

|*cbc:PropertyGroupTypeCode*
|Code
|1
|Code addressed to control the behavior of the group of criteria.
|*Information Requirement*: 
http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.0-tbr070-013[_tbr070-013_]. 

*Rule*:  Compulsory use of the Code List `PropertyGroupType`. See sections below about the 'criteria data structures' and the XML examples on exclusion and selection criteria to understand the use of this code. Beware that the first element inside a group of properties (after the group ID) is always a cac:TenderingCriterionProperty. In some occasions this might entail the use of an empty CAPTION element, for instance, to produce groups of subgroups where no property does really makes sense in the first group.

*Rule scope*: Common (BR-TC-14, BR-TC-15, BR-OTH-01, BR-OTH-01#11, BR-OTH-03)

|*cac:TenderingCriterionProperty*
|Class
|1..n
|Caption (i.e. a 'label'), specific MS or contracting authority requirement (e.g. 'Number of references expected: 5' or a question addressed to the economic operator (e.g. 'Your average yearly turnover for the past three years?'.
|*Information Requirement*: 
http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.0-tbr070-013[_tbr070-013_]. 

*Rule*:   See the rules for the class in the tables below to see the rules related to criterion properties. See also the XML examples provided in sections about exclusion and selection criteria. 

|*cac:SubsidiaryTenderingCriterionPropertyGroup*
|Class
|0..n
|A second, third or n-level group inside a first level group of properties.
|*Information Requirement*: http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.0-tbr070-013[_tbr070-013_]. 

*Rule*:  subsidiary property groups 'are' property groups (i.e. its the same component but qualified as 'subsidary'). Therefore all the rules applicable to property groups are also applicable to sub-groups: Compulsory use of the Code List `PropertyGroupType`. See sections below about the 'criteria data structures' and the XML examples on exclusion and selection criteria to understand the use of this code. Beware that the first element inside a group of properties (after the group ID) is always a cac:TenderingCriterionProperty. In some occasions this might entail the use of an empty CAPTION element, for instance, to produce groups of subgroups where no property does really makes sense in the first group.

==== XML Examples

. See examples in sections about exclusion and selection criteria.

. You will notice in the examples that the elements `cbc:Name` and `cbc:Description` of groups and subgroups of properties are never used. As a common practice the ESPD documents use instead a first `cac:TenderingCriterionProperty` of type CAPTION (i.e. an informative property that act as a 'label').
