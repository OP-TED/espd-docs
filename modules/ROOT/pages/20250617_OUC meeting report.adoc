== Summary OUC meeting 1^st^ April 2025

* The main topics discussed in April were summarised:
** ESPD-EDM modelled in Enterprise Architect (.eapx file available on GitHub).
** New features and tools: alignment with eCertis UUIDs and eForms code lists, the export of EA structure into JSON, JSON schema for ESPD-EDM.
** ESPD Demo – implemented improvements: Integrated SurveyJS and PDFMake.
** GitHub status – closed tickets (15 in total) as part of backlog.

== GitHub status

* Two tickets have been closed since the last meeting:
** https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/issues/424[#424] (++[++Question++]++: Where could we find translations for SUBCRITERIONs descriptions), and
** https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/issues/422[#422] (Purely national Exclusion Ground - dynamic structure).

____
Both issues were created by colleagues from Slovenia. #424 is part of v4.1.0 release, meanwhile #422 is not applicable, as it was part of old v2 releases.
____

* There are two open issues, both answered (waiting user’s feedback):
** https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/issues/426[#426] (++[++Question++]++: Selection criteria).
** https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/issues/422[#422] (SUBCRITERION QUESTION should not be mandatory), new version of Excel Criterion file is proposed.

== What's new in the ESPD-Model for Q1 and Q2 2025

* A long-term plan and achieved progress were presented:
** ESPD-EDM fully implemented and modelled in Enterprise Architect (EA). New way to manage ESPD-EDM: from Excel to EA, from XML to JSON.
** Develop tools to allow automatic extraction and processing of EA. Export structure into JSON format. JSON schema for validation.
** Generate full ESPD Request and Response examples on ESPD Demo site.
** Continue with support for ESPD-EDM Excel files.
** Integration with eCertis and eForms, alignment with ePO and eForms. Criterion, National and EU Legislation to be retrieved from eCertis via UUIDs. Enhancement of the UBL model.
** Work on ESPD documentation, preparing the new ESPD-EDM workflow.

== Insights from Belgium’s Implementation of Version 3

* The colleagues from BOSA (Belgium) presented implementation of v3.3.0.
* Introduction and goals:
** The tool is a customised version of EC service (EDM 1.0.2), a stand-alone application with optional use (non-structured formats are also allowed).
** Short-term goals: extended data model; integrate ESPD with existing pre-award flows; improvements based on users’ feedback. Long-term goals: user-friendliness for Economic Operators; integration with authentic sources; semi-automatic evaluation; align with EDM 4.X.X or beyond.
* Difficulties encountered: implementation is different from the one for eForms; a lot of DIY in validation; code lists not always aligned with eForms in v3; need for updated; the Model allows 'national' adaptations.
* Choices made: JSON instead of XML (this choice has also been adopted by the ESPD-EDM Team for a future release, work ongoing); deviations from EDM (input types, cardinalities).
* Appreciated: extensive and well-organised documentation, OP's responsiveness and availability, regular OUC meetings to "stay in the loop".
* Could be improved: align data model with eForms, update the ESPD regulation and apply universal datamodel, enrich the business handbook with detailed information on criteria (purpose, etc.)
* A live presentation of the new service was provided, but work is still ongoing.

== Next steps

* Restructure GitHub repositories to align with eForms and ePO .
* Documentation enhancement (images as code, etc.);
* Align to other standards (eCertis, eForms, ePO, UBL 2.4);
* V4.1.0 release ongoing: moving Evidence block at top level for all Criteria; Subcriterion simplification;

== Next meetings & AOB

* The next OUC meeting is planned for the 2^nd^ October 2025.
* The Annual Seminar is planned again as part of Tenders Electronic Daily event for 26th-27th November 2025, with other Unit’s projects: eForms, eSenders, eProcurement Ontology and others. More information about TED events can be found in https://ted.europa.eu/en/2025-event-calendar[event calendar].
* In “other business” were presented:
** eProcurement Ontology has been moved to a maintenance modus.
** Incoming TED event: 26th of June - eSenders workshop.
** Brief discussion about the last EXEP meeting and the proposal to modify the Procurement Directives.
