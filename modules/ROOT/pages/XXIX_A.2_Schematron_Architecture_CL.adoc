==== Architecture for Code List validation

The validation of the code lists needs an extra step on the process before executing the Schematron process. This is because it needs https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=codelist[Genericode] (GC) as input files.

. The first step is the *generation of Genericode (GC) files*. These files contains information about the values and identifiers of each code list.
.. GC files are found in the link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.1.0/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/gc[Validation folder].

. *Design and implementation of the CVA files*. http://docs.oasis-open.org/codelist/ns/ContextValueAssociation/1.0/[CVA] stands for Context and Value Association:

. *Execution of the implemented validations* in the CVA files:

.. Transformation of CVA files into SCH files.

.. Continue with the Schematron execution process: (1) transformation of SCH files into XSLT and execution of the validations using the XSLT files to get the final report.

==== What does the SCH file contain?

. Association between one or more elements of the XML and one or more code list (specified in the Genericodes).
. The declaration of which attributes of the XML identify information of the Genericode.


The implementation of the CVA file has the following structure:

==== Execution

As a basis of the implementation, it has been taken into account:

This example describes the execution of the validation process using the http://saxon.sourceforge.net/[Saxon library] to execute XSLT files and the XSLT provided as a basis:
