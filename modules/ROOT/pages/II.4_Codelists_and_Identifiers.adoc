=== II.4 Codes and Identifiers

A code is a shortened way (a number or a short abbreviated text), leading to the definition of a 'concept'. The code itself represents and replaces the concept.

An Identifier, in turn, can be defined as “a value (represented as a short text, a number or a combination of both) used to establish the identity of, and distinguish uniquely, one occurrence of an object following a pattern” . 

The essential distinctive features between identifiers and codes are:

. Identifiers point at specific occurrences of objects (instances); codes replace concepts;

. Identifiers are virtually limitless while codes are finite. In other words, identifier lists are “open” (the lists may grow) and code list are “closed” (practically never updated, once consolidated). Hence codes are maintained in 'Codelists' whilst identifiers are usually kept in databases.

. Identifiers are in principle maintained in the business domain, e.g. buyer identifiers, economic operator identifiers, exclusion or selection criteria identifiers, etc.

. Codes may belong to three different domains: 

.. they can be somehow 'business-agnostic' and be used cross-domain (e.g. country codes, currency codes, language codes, etc.); 

.. business-specific domain (i.e. procurement specific, like codes representing contract types, procurement procedure types, criteria types, etc.); and 

.. business process-specific, i.e. ESPD-specific, such as the data type expected in the response to a criterion, or the type of a criterion property, etc.
