==== Response

The `ccv:Response` class is used by the economic operator to answer a specific Requirement issued by
the contracting body. 

[.text-left]
.Providing the expected data type 
[IMPORTANT]
====
The XSD Schema defines multiple types of data for the response (Indicator, Amount, Date, etc.), 
only one response data MUST be provided. And the data provided in the response MUST match the one specified in the attribute of the class ccv:Requirement.

The economic operator MUST use the code list link:./code_lists/pdf/ResponseDataType.pdf[ResponseDataType] and make sure that the data provided is of the same type that the
one expected by the contracting authority (See the column ''Type of value expected by the
current version of the ESPD Service'').

5+^|*Attributes*

|*pi*
|Processing Instruction. Reserved for non-standard processing of the class;

|OPTIONAL  (0..1)
|`*Comment*: This attribute is defined in the ESPDRequest XSD Schema. The ESPD Service does not make any use of this attribute`

5+^|*Properties*

|*cbc:ID*
|A language-independent token, e.g., a number, that allows to identify a Response
|
|OPTIONAL (0..1)
|`*Comment*: This id SHOULD be provided by the EO or the service provider that instantiates the ESPDResponse XML document`

|*ccv-cbc:Indicator*
|Indicates a positive or a negative answer provided by the economic operator as an answer to a question in the Requirement

</ccv:Requirement>
----
|OPTIONAL (0..1)
|`*Comment*: The only possible values are _False_ and _True_

|*cbc:Description*
|A textual description of a criterion response that describes how an
economic operators fulfills an specific criterion
|
|OPTIONAL (0..1)

|*cbc:Amount*
|Declared amount that fulfills this criterion

 <ccv:Response>
  <cbc:Amount 
  currencyID="EUR">
  100000
  </cbc:Amount>
 </ccv:Response>
</ccv:Requirement>
----
|OPTIONAL (0..1)
|`*Rule*: The currencyID attribute is MANDATORY (e.g. "EUR"). Compulsory use of the code list link:./code_lists/pdf/CountryCodeIdentifier.pdf[CountryCodeIdentifier]. BEWARE that amounts can use decimal separators (e.g. 14134,95 but not hundred or thousand separators)`

|*ccv-cbc:Code*
|A code pointing at a definition of a concept as the answer to the Requirement
|
|OPTIONAL (0..1)
|`*Comment*: The current ESPD Service does not use this property, but consider for example a 
Requirement asking for a country code: in that case this would be the right placeholder for the
expected data

|*cbc:Date*
|Declared date that fulfills this criterion
a|
[source,xml]
----
<ccv:Requirement

	</ccv:Response>
</ccv:Requirement>
----
|OPTIONAL (0..1)
|`*Rule*: The date format MUST be 'YYYY-MM-DD', where 'Y' stands for 'Year', 'M' for 'Month', and 'D' for 'Day'

 </ccv:Requirement>
----
|OPTIONAL (0..1)
|`*Rule*: do not format the percentage with the "%" symbol, just provide a float value like in the example`

|*cbc:Quantity*
|Declared quantity that fullfills the criterion

*EXAMPLE 1*:
<ccv:Requirement

  </ccv:Response>
</ccv:Requirement>
----
|OPTIONAL (0..1)
|`*Comment*: BEWARE that different types of Quantities can be required, some of them with a special attribute. See the column "Type of value expected by the
current version of the ESPD Service" of the code list link:./code_lists/pdf/ResponseDataType.pdf[ResponseDataType]. See also the note
below about "Quantities"`

|*cac:Period*
|Declared period that fulfills the Criterion
a|
[source,xml]
----
<ccv:Response>
 <cac:Period>
  <cbc:Description>5 months</cbc:Description>
 </cac:Period>
</ccv:Response>
----
|OPTIONAL (0..1)
|`*Rule*: For the time being the ESPD Service uses the text field Description of the cac:Period class. Future versions of the ESPD Service would leverage the features of this UBL component`

|*cev-cac:Evidence*
|One or more references to a source where a documentary proof can be obtained to demonstrate that one stated response does actually
fulfill the Requirement from a Criterion  
|
|OPTIONAL (0..n)
|`*Comment*: The current ESPD Service only allows the specification of one evidence. Beware that the economic operator may use one evidence
to prove different Requirements. For this the EO will have to duplicate the reference to the same evidence
for each Requirement where the reference to the Evidence is relevant`
 

|*RelatedParty*
|A party that may be affected by the response provided by the economic operator
|
|OPTIONAL (0..1)
|`*Comment*: The ESPD Service does not use this feature for the time being`

.About the different types of *Quantities* 
[IMPORTANT]
====
Up to three different types of Quantities can be specified: (1) QUANTITY_INTEGER, 
a number representing a quantity in a specific unit of measure. The unit has to be 
specified (e.g. number of workers); (2) QUANTITY_YEAR, a non-negative integer 
(i.e. a natural number) representing a year. The unit has to be specified as YEAR, and 
(3) QUANTITY, a number representing a generic quantity with no unit specified (e.g. a ratio).

Beware that in the case of QUANTITY_INTEGER and QUANTITY_YEAR the attribute *_unitCode_* MUST be always 
specified (See code list link:./code_lists/pdf/ResponseDataType.pdf[ResponseDataType]).
