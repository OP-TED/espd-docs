|*cbc:ID*
|Identifier
|1
|A reference to one or more lots the economic operator is applying for. The original lot definition is part of the call for tender document. The Qualification instance only references the corresponding IDs in order to establish the connection to the call for tender information.

|*Information Requirement*: 
http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.0-tbr070-008[_tbr070-008_]. 

*Rule*: Compulsory use of schemeAgencyID attribute. If several lots are present check that the type of the `cbc:QualificationApplicationResponse` element is set to `SELFCONTAINED`; otherwise a fatal exception should be thrown. As for the *Regulated* version, if only one Lot is specified its ID has to be set to '0' thus indicating that the procurement procedure is not divided into Lots.

*Rule scope*: SELF-CONTAINED (BR-LOT-10, BR-LOT-30-S10, BR-OTH-02)
