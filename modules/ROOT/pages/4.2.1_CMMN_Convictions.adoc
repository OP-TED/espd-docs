=== Convictions
 
The label ''Convictions'' groups all the criteria related to the offences for which an 
Economic Operator may have been convicted footnote:[This notation _CRITERION.EXCLUSION.CONVICTION.*_ is to 
be read as ''it applies to all the selection criteria, which are part of the exclusion criteria group''. 
See the link:./code_lists/xls/CriteriaTaxonomy.xlsx[criteria tables]
for the complete taxonomy of criteria and each criterion code label.]:
 
 	* CRITERION.EXCLUSION.CONVICTIONS.*: ''participation in a criminal organisation'', ''corruption'', ''fraud'', ''terrorist offences linked to terrorist activities'', ''money laundering or terrorist financing'', ''child labour and other forms of trafficking in human beings''.
 	
In an ESPD Service conformant XML document all these criteria share the same structure. The Figure 21 above provides a simple view of how the data of a `Conviction` exclusion criterion
is organised. This other figure represents practically the same idea, but from a ''data-structuring'' perspective:
