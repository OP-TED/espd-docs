=== 3. *OTHER CRITERIA*

For the time being, the ESPD Service use this group to cover the criteria related to the Economic Operator that are used to enhance
its selection (and could even be used to make a decision about its awarding).

In the link:./code_lists/pdf/CriteriaTypeCode.pdf[Criteria Taxonomy] code list these criteria are
classified as ''CRITERION.OTHER.EO_DATA.*''. The complete list of these criteria is accessible in the table 
link:./code_lists/xls/CriteriaTaxonomy.xlsx[ESPD Criteria: Other Criteria] (please have
a look into this table, it will help you better understand how these criteria work in the ESPD Service):

	. ''[..] Is the economic operator a sheltered workshop, a 'social business' or will it provide for the performance of the contract in the context of sheltered employment programmes?'';
	. ''[..]is the economic operator registered on an official list of approved economic operators or does it have an equivalent certificate [..]'';
	. '' Is the economic operator participating in the procurement procedure together with others?''
	. ''Does the economic operator rely on the capacities of other entities in order to meet the selection criteria set out under Part IV and the criteria and rules (if any) set out under Part V below?''
	. ''Does the economic operator intend to subcontract any share of the contract to third parties?''
	. ''It meets the objective and non discriminatory criteria or rules to be applied in order to limit the number of candidates in the following way: In case certain certificates or 
	other forms of documentary evidence are required, please indicate for each whether the economic operator has the required documents:'';
	
For the most part these criteria have no ''data-structures'' and ''decision points'' as all the Exclusion criteria an some selection criteria do have. 
They are mostly presented as plain lists of data that the EO has to provide in case it particular situation fits to one of those criteria.     

The diagram below illustrates the first criterion of the above list (''[..] Is the economic operator a sheltered workshop [..]''):
