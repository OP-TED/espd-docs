References relate to those criteria where the Economic Operator is requested to demonstrate experience in one works execution, 
service performance or supply delivery. In all three cases the structure is the same and, as for ''turnovers'' or ''ratio'' it also contains 
an iterative structure that can repeat as many times as requested by the Contracting Authority in the contract documents. In this case the 
repetitive structure asks for a description, an amount, a date and the related recipients of the work, service or supply.

The corresponding data-structure diagram would be this one:
