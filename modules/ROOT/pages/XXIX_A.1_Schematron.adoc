=== Introduction to ISO Schematron

Schematron is a rule-based validation language to specify validation processes against XML documents.
ISO Schematron is an ISO (ISO/IEC 19757-3:2006) and open standard.
Please visit the link:http://www.schematron.com/[ISO Schematron] web-site for the technical specification and details.

==== ESPD Business Rules

The ESPD-EDM uses Schematron to validate business rules identified in
ESPD_TestCases_v10.docx and ESPD_TestCases_mapping_v10.docx
link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.1.0/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/doc[documents].
The business requirements taken as input for these rules are specified in the
link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt[ESPDint Business Document].
 
These business rules can be typified as:

. *Semantic validations*: e.g. The "cac:TenderingCriterionResponse" in a Response document MUST match one, and only one,
of the "cac:TenderingCriterionProperty" elements in the XML instance of the corresponding ESPD-Request;

. *Assertions* about the presence or absence of patterns in XML documents: e.g. all business rules that apply to
identifier nodes: mandatory attributes, structure of the identifier, etc.;

. *Code lists* validations: e.g. values and attributes for each code list element;

. *Other validations* that an XSD cannot do: e.g. Validates that one of the nodes has at least 1 child.


The following image shows different examples of validations:

The validation of code lists is explained in sections below.
