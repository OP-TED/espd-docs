|The contracting body shall provide the exclusion grounds and selection criteria for its tendering process as structured information â€“ via ESPD template or structured list of criteria set out in a call for tender.
|===

The ESPD-EDM defined a flexible structure to express data about criteria. Based on this structure UBL-2.2 defined in turn the component `cac:TenderingCriterion`, which is used in ESPD-EDM V2.1.0 to implement the XML objects for exclusion and selection criteria.

The UML diagram below provides a graphic view of the `QualificationApplicationRequest` document with the complete structure for the `cac:TenderingCriterion` component (cf. section on the ESPD Response, furhter on this guide, to understand how the QualificationApplicationResponse deals with Criteria).

=== IV.1 General behavior

*Notice that*:

. One criterion *may* have descendent 'sub-criteria'. This is very useful to, for example, define national exclusion criteria that specialise the EU criteria defined in the Directive;

. One criterion *may* refer to one or several pieces of legislation (EU, national, other);

. One criterion *must* always contain at least one group of 'properties'. Properties may be informative captions; general requirements issued by the Member State or procedure-specific requirements specified by the contracting authority; and questions addressed to the economic operator;

. One group of properties *must* always specify at least one 'property';

. One group of properties *may* contain one or several 'sub-groups' of properties.

==== XSD Schema

This XSD Schema diagram shows a global view of the UBL-2.2 `cac:TenderingCriterion` component:
