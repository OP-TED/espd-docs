5+^|"_A group of requirements with a specific structure relating to one Criterion_"

5+^|*Attributes*

|*pi*
|Processing Instruction. Reserved for non-standard processing of the class; e.g. for hiding or showing elements in a user interface
|
|OPTIONAL  (0..1)
|`*Comment*: This attribute is defined in the ESPDRequest XSD Schema. In the case of the RequirementGroup element the ESPD Service uses
this attribute to specify whether the elements within the group must be shown or not. See the introduction to the section 
"IV Criteria Data Flows" for a detailed explanation on the use of this attribute.`

5+^|*Associated classes*

|*Requirement*
|Request by the Contracting Authority oriented to determine how the Economic Operator 
meets a concrete aspect of the Criterion  
|
|*MANDATORY* (1..n)
|

|*RequirementGroup*
|Subgroup(s) of nested Requirements catering for the construction of data flows including
decision fork points
|(See the example about a complete Criterion below=
|*MANDATORY* (1..n)
|

|===

[NOTE]
A CriterionRequirementGroup MAY contain sub-groups of criteria. This nested structure allows the ESPD to represent
complex decision structures and capture faithfully the data represented in highly structured user interfaces
(like the one implemented in the ESPD Service). This is clearly illustrated in the next sections.
