=== 1. *EXCLUSION CRITERIA*

For Procurement Projects where the value of the contract is above the threshold, all 
ESPDRespone XML documents MUST specify all the exclusion criteria defined in the Directive. Thus the following general rule:

include::4.2.0_GENERAL_RULE_3.adoc[]

[.text-left]
Criteria may be grouped in several different categories. The figure below is 
intended to identify and list these categories for the Exclusion criteria (branches in text boxes), and specific subgroups 
within each category (leaves in text without boxes):

[.text-center]
[[exclusion_criteria_taxonomy]]
.Exclusion criteria taxonomy
image::exclusion_criteria_taxonomy.png[alt="exclusion_criteria", width="800", height="1200"]

[.text-left]
Each of these categories has its own particular data structure, which can be represented as 
flow diagrams like the one in the figure above (see Figure 21. ''General data-structure design rule for criteria and requirements with a _yes_ or _no_ answer''). 
Thus the data structures below represent how the data is organised for each exclusion criterion used in the ESPD.

[NOTE]
====
The exclusion criteria have been drafted ''from a negative perspective''. Thus a criterion like `Payment of Taxes`
is drafted like follows:

_Has the economic operator breached its obligations relating to the payment of taxes, both in the 
country in which it is established and in Member State of the contracting authority or contracting 
entity if other than the country of establishment?_

If the Economic Operator answers ''no'' then it has nothing to justify or motivate. On the 
contrary if it answers ''yes'' it will have to provide additional data and evidences to prove 
that the criterion is satisfied.

The ESPD Service applies this approach as much as possible.
