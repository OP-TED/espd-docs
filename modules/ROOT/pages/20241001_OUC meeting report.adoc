** Integration of eCertis, ESPD and eForms

== Documentation – a new UX Design

* A new https://docs.ted.europa.eu/ESPD-EDM/latest/index.html[ESPD-EDM documentation] site is presented. The comparation with the previous version shows that the new design is aligned with other TED projects. A brief remark for all using old versions: they are preserved and available by the links in drop-down menu. With more details as separate slides are presented the sections: "Information for Business Users" (with separated topics for general information and introduction to the ESPD legislation, roadmap, etc. but also structure of an ESPT Service example, and how to fill online form), "Technical Implementation" (with topics ordered by logic of usage) and “Documentation - OUC Meeting and Seminars” (with separated topic for meeting scheduler, regular meetings and annual seminars. New GitHub templates are presented: for reporting an error, general comments or improvement suggestion. The presentation included a live presentation of ESPD Documentation (online). The attendees’ feedback was very positive during the meeting.

== V4 available on-line – new features and tools

* New release v4.0.0 is presented as a central part of the meeting. The list of new features is reviewed with special attention to model changes: alignment with ePO, IDs based on XML Path, improved lot management. New model structure is presented by separate slides for new Criterion examples, but also for useful tools for implementers and developers (batch .bat file for validation, XML files ESPD-Request.xml and ESPD-Response, new folder structure and content, etc.), tools in https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/tree/espd-tools[espd-tools] branch (for transformation of Criterion and Code List Excel files to UBL and .gc and web format) and https://github.com/OP-TED/espd-validation-schematron[Schematron validation] branch.

== ESPD Demo – Interactive creation of examples v4

* A new ESPD demo site is presented, including the link to https://docs.ted.europa.eu/espd-demo/[demo site]. The tool provides clear visualization of ESPD request end response in interactive process and allows creation of examples for v4.0.0 but also for v3.3.0 validation with corresponding error, etc. Messages. On attendee’s request one live example has been executed. Special attention was paid to questions related to implementation of national requirements within the mark of ESPD model.

== GitHub issues – closed

* The list of 23 GitHub issues closed during 2024 is presented:
** The minor part related to clarifications, documentation and previous v3.3.0 release was mentioned briefly.
** On the other hand, all v4.0.0 issues were reviewed one by one, except https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/issues/388[#388] and https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/issues/389[#389] analyzed previously within general data structure update presentation.

== Next meetings

* Annual Seminar – this year the Tenders Electronic Daily Unit is planning to organize one single event for the different projects dealt with in the Unit: eForms, eSenders, eProcurement Ontology, ESPD and others. The proposed date is from 3 to 4 December. It is foreseen to be a hybrid meeting (on site or online). Attendees are asked to express their interest for attending in person in Luxembourg.
