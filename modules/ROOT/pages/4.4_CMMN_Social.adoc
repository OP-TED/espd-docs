	environmental law'', ''breaching of obligations in the fields of social law'' 
	and ''breaching of obligations in the fields of labour law''.
	
All these criteria are specified based on the same data structure:

* Contrary to the criteria so far studied this one does not include the group of requirements requesting evidences (see also [DOC-REF-1]).
