=== I.3 The ESPD Profile

The ESPD profile realises the ESPD process, which is is part of the qualification process in the pre-awarding process area. This is represented in the diagram below:

The roles that participate as business partners in this process are mainly:

. The Buyer (or ESDP requester) normally a governmental organisation like a contracting authority who prepares the procurement procedure requirements in a ESPDRequest (electronic document `QualificationApplicationRequest`); and
. The Supplier (i.e. economic operators), or ESPD Providers acting on behalf of them, who answer in an ESPDResponse (electronic document `QualificationApplicationResponse`).

This other figure below shows the choreography of the business process implemented by the profile. The choreography of business collaborations defines the sequence of interactions when the profile is run within its context.
