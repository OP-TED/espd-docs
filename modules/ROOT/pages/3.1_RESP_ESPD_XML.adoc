=== Data Model overview
The UML Diagram below provides a simplified view of the ESPDResponse document. Notice that the classes herein represented belong to different data-packages.  
Hence each class name is preceded by different prefixes representing their corresponding namespaces: "espd::", "ccv::", "cev::", "cac::" (see ''
Table 1. Schemas, namespaces and prefixes used by the ESPDResponse''). footnote:[this UML was produced using the MS-Visio tool, thus the double semicolon "::" 
after the prefix. The XML syntax only uses one semicolon ":".]

As you can see in the diagram more than 50% of the classes were already defined in UBL-2.1 (cac-prefixed classes). Moreover, many of the "root" elements in the espd:ESPDRequest class reuse 
UBL-2.1 Common Basic Components. This document does not represent nor describe in its entirety the entities modelled in UBL that are re-used in the ESPD. Any detail on the model, 
schemata, and any other artefact relating to UBL-2.1 can be freely downloaded here: http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/os-UBL-2.1/UBL-2.1.html. Nonetheless those parts of the UBL 
components that are commonly used in the ESPD documents are herein sufficiently identified and commented.

According to the UML Diagram an ESPDResponse XML document is represented by the class `espd:ESPDResponse`.
This ''root'' class aggregates other classes (which in turn aggregate sub-classes). 
The list below summarises the use of each of these classes. Further on, in this document, 
each class is analysed and illustrated in more detail:

[.text-left]
. The `cac:ContractingParty`, defined in UBL-2.1,  is used to specify data relating the Contracting Authority, Body or Entity. All ESPD Requests MUST provide some basic data about 
the Contracting Body. 

. The `espd:EconomicOperator` class is defined by COM as a placeholder for all the data related to the 
Economic Operator. This class aggregates an espd:RepresentativeNaturalPerson class intended to gather
the data of the legal representatives of the EO. It also reuses the UBL-2.1 cac:Party class.  

. The `cac:ProcurementProjectLot` class was also defined in UBL-2.1 to hold data about the Lots in which a Procurement Project has been divided. The ESPD Request XML documents MUST use 
this class to specify whether the Procurement Project has lots or not and to identify them. Although the ESPD-EDM model was designed to support multiple lots, the 
current version of the ESPDService, however, still does not fully uses this feature and permits only to describe them.  

. The `ccv:Criterion` class belongs to the Core Criterion Vocabulary data-package, thus the ccv: prefix.footnote:[see the CCV-CommonAggregateComponents-1.0.xsd library for its XML definition] . It is a compulsory element of multiple cardinality allowing for the 
specification of both the exclusion and selection criteria in an ESPD Request.

. `cac:ServiceProviderParty` is a specialisation of the cac:Party class, both defined in UBL-2.1. It is used to inform about the party responsible of the system that provided the data 
included in the document; e.g. a pre-qualification system, a procurement platform, etc. The absence of this element indicates that the data has been provided by the Economic Operator itself. 

. `cac:Signature` class is used to include an electronic signature in the document. In general, the presence of an electronic signature aims at ensuring authenticity, integrity and 
non-repudiation. Different methods of signing an electronic document exist, and some of them do not need embedding the signature in the document. The cardinality 0..1 of this 
class in the `espd:ESPDRequest` document allows the use of other electronic signature methods that do not imply the use of this class in an ESPD Request XML document. Therefore, 
the absence implies that authentic, integrity, etc. are solved by other means.

. `cac:AdditionalDocumentReference` is used to include external references to information that can be accessed from a URL. In contracts above the threshold
this element is used by the CA in the ESPDRequest to refer to the Contract Notice published in TeD. Other documents or information accessible through a URL that might be considered relevant 
MAY be specified by the Contracting Authority (in the ESPDRequest) or by the EO (in the ESPDResponse) through 
the use of multiple instances of this element.

The next sections deal with the specific details of each one of these classes and provide guidelines, rules 
and examples on how to produce XML documents that are conformant with the ESPD Service ESPDResponse XML document and 
for contracts above the threshold.
