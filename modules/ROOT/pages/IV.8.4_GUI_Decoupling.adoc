==== Business data and GUI decoupling

The business domain semantics should be decoupled from its management processes. Thus eBusiness Documents footnote:[the
link:https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/home_en[ISA2 Programme] provides this draft definition for eBusiness Document: "a set
of interrelated Business Information representing the business facts, data, or opinions, in any medium or form,
including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audio-visual forms that the capability exchanges
with other capabilities to support the execution of value streams". For the purposes of the ESPD, the content of
eBusiness Document is always data structures according to the ESPD-Exchange Data Model (EDM) specification.] should
not contain processing instructions but just data about the business domain. One counter-example for this statement are
those cases when the XML instances contain processing instructions for a software GUI solution to manage how the layout
must behave or how the data must be presented.

For the time being, the ESPD-EDM does not conform 100% to this rule: the purpose of the code lists `PropertyGroupType` and
`BooleanGUIControlType` and of the CAPTION tag aim precisely to the opposite. They are not part of the Business
Domain Data Model.

One reason that led to include these kind of "processing instructions" in the ESPD-Exchange Data Model is the
high level of abstraction of the ISA2 Core Criterion and Evidence Vocabulary (CCEV) (the UBL-2.2 `cac:TenderingCriterion`
is a specialisation of this vocabulary). As GROUPs and SUBGROUPS of REQUIREMENT(s) and of QUESTION(s) may be freely and
unlimitedly nested, the software applications may have a
hard time to detect whether a GROUP or SUBGROUP contains REQUIREMENT(s) and QUESTION(s) or just QUESTION(s) (which is usual in
the ESP-EDM specification). Or vice-versa, if a GROUP or SUBGROUP comes first with QUESTION(s) followed by REQUIREMENT(s)
(something that never happens in the ESPD-EDM specification).

One way for the ESPD-EDM to help software applications understand that a nested data structure is a GROUP of
REQUIREMENT(s) or just of QUESTION(s) would have been codifying it as "REQUIREMENT_GROUP" or "QUESTION_GROUP", using for that purpose
the element `cbc:PropertyGroupTypeCode` element (similarly to what is done with the `cbc:TypeCode` element inside the
`cac:TenderingCriterionProperty`). However for backwards compatibility reasons with the MS software applications the
decision was made to reserve the `cbc:PropertyGroupTypeCode` to control the GUI behaviour by means of the values
defined in the code list
link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/blob/2.1.0/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/xlsx/ESPD-CodeLists-V2.1.0.xlsx[PropertyGroupType]
(codes ON*, ONTRUE and ONFALSE).

The way currently used by software applications to detect whether a GROUP (or SUBGROUP) carries REQUIREMENT(s) or not is to
look at the type of the first criterion property: if the first `cac:TenderingCriterionProperty` is of `cbc:TypeCode`
value `REQUIREMENT` then it is a `REQUIREMENT_GROUP`, if it is of value `QUESTION` then the GROUP (or SUBGROUP) contains
only QUESTION(s).

In future versions, the ESPD-EDM should get rid of these codes and mechanisms that couple the eProcurement Data Model to the
dynamic building-up of the Graphic User Interfaces (GUIs) or to other processing needs. One possible solution could be to separate the
particular software applications needs from the business data model by means of ''annotations'' that can be linked to each
data element that needs it, at integration data time (i.e. when acquiring the data; e.g. just after
the reception of an eBusiness Document from another system).

For this, imagine that each element of the Criteria Taxonomy data structures could contain (or be preceded by) one or more
instructions addressed to the software application for one particular purpose, as illustrated in the figure below (elements
starting with an *@* symbol):

The fragment of XML code below illustrates how a mediation service, after reception and storage
footnote:[Received eBusiness Document should be preserved as it was sent, unaltered, before applying any enrichment, otherwise the evidence value would be lost.],
could enrich the XML instance containing the business data with processing instruction annotations, based on the annotated data structure shown above
(the complete example can be found in the folder
