. *mod*: UBL-2.3 model specified in spread-sheets;
. *val*: validation artefacts (eg. ISO Schematron and OASIS Genericode CVA files);
. *xml*: samples of ESPD XML instances for illustrative and testing purposes;
. *xsd*: the UBL-2.3 XSD Schemas, documented (annotated) version;
. *xsdrt*: the UBL-2.3 XSD Schemas, runtime version;
. *xslt*: transformation stylesheets used to generate basic sample XML instances from the criteria defined in spreadsheets (see folder link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/3.0.0/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl[dist/cl]).
