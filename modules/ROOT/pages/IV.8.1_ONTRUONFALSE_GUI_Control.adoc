==== ONTRUE/ONFALSE codes for GROUP and SUBGROUP control

Three codes concerning the GROUPS or SUBGROUPS of REQUIREMENT(s) and QUESTION(s) are defined in the code list
link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/blob/2.1.0/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/xlsx/ESPD-CodeLists-V2.1.0.xlsx[PropertyGroupType]:

. ON*, meaning that the GROUP or SUBGROUP has to be processed always;
. ONTRUE, meaning that the GROUP or SUBGROUP has to be processed, and announcing that a GROUP or SUBGROUP is coming
next which must not be processed *if the value of the closer QUESTION of type INDICATOR* is `true`;
. ONFALSE, meaning that the GROUP or SUBGROUP must be processed *if the value of the closer QUESTION of type INDICATOR* is `false`;

These codes are used for a software application modules to know whether it has to process a concrete GROUP or SUBGROUP.
If the objective of the module is, for example, to build dynamically the Graphic User Interface (GUI) - based on the
ESPD-Request or an ESPD-Response XML instance-, then a GROUP or SUBGROUP marked as ONTRUE implies that the GROUP or
SUBGROUP content is to be shown, whilst the one marked as ONFALSE needs to be hidden. GROUPS and SUBGROUPS marked as
ON* imply that has to be always shown. You can see this mechanism as a way of implementing ''choices'' or
''switch/cases'' inside a Criterion Data Structure.

The figure below illustrates how the ONTRUE and ONFALSE SUBGROUPS of a Criterion of type "Contributions
(Exclusion Grounds)" relate to each of its ''closer QUESTION'' of type INDICATOR (see boxes and lines coloured in blue):

The screen-captures below illustrate how the European Commission's ESP Service processed the GUI for the Exclusion Criterion
''Contributions'' based on this mechanism:

.Case 1: When the first QUESTION ''Your Answer?'' is set to `false`:

.Case 2: When the first QUESTION ''Your Answer?'' is set to `true`:

.Case 3: When the first QUESTION ''Your Answer?'' and the option "Has this breach of obligations been established ..." are both set to `true`:

.Case 4: When all the QUESTION(s) that are INDICATORS are set to `true`
