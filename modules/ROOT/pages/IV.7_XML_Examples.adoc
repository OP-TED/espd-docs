=== IV.7 XML examples and tools

The fact of presenting the data structures as a spread-sheet book had an additional reason: *to use the spread-sheet as an elementary prototype tool to generate the XML instances of the criteria for the ESPD Request and ESDP Response documents*.

Thus the folder link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.1.1/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/xslt/ODS%20Data%20Structures%20to%20ESPD%20XML[dist/xslt/ODS Data Structures to ESPD XML] contains four XSL style-sheets that facilitate the generation of the complete set of criteria required in an ESDP Request or in an ESDP Response XML file.

For this, you can use the following method: 
Rename the `.ods` files as `.ods.zip` and extract the file 'content.xml'; use an XML editor to load the 'content.xml' file and the XSL-T file. Associate (or reference) the XSLT file to the XML. Launch the transformation from the XML Editor. Save the output file.

Beware that this solution is a simple prototype aimed at generating the complete list of criteria that may occur in an ESDP Request and the responses (but not the the criteria properties) in an ESPD Response. 

The following features *are implemented* in the first set of transformation XSL-T style-sheet (`BASIC-ESPDRequest-Annotated-V2.1.1.xslt` and `EXTENDED-ESPDRequest-Annotated-V2.1.1.xslt`):

* All the root elements are created and commented;

* An empty contracting authority is created in the ESPD Request and ESPD Response (no data about any CA is supplied); just the necessary for the XML to be validated against the XSD schema;

* An empty economic operator is created in the ESPD Response (no data about any EO is supplied); just the necessary for the XML to be validated against the XSD schema;

* All the exclusion and selection criteria in the spread-sheets are created;

* Per each criterion a complete Legislation object is instantiated with 'dummy' values.

The following features *are NOT implemented* in the first set of transformation XSL-T style-sheet (`BASIC-ESPDRequest-Annotated-V2.1.1.xslt` and `EXTENDED-ESPDRequest-Annotated-V2.1.1.xslt`):

* The publications and document references requested in the business requirements are not generated; but the XML examples provided in the distribution do contain examples of TED and national publications (both for the ESPD Request and ESPD Response examples. See files BASIC-ESPDRequest-2.1.1.xml, BASIC-ESPDResponse-2.1.1.xml, EXTENDED-ESPDRequest-2.1.1.xml and EXTENDED-ESPDResponse-2.1.1.xml, in the link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.1.1/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/xml[xml folder].

* The response value and cardinality are shown for informative purposes. No functionality is currently implemented based on them, but could be used in future improved versions of the prototype;

The following features *are implemented* in the second set of transformation XSL-T style-sheet (`From-BASIC-REQUEST_to_RESPONSE.xslt` and `From-EXTENDED-REQUEST_to_RESPONSE.xslt` files):

* All the root elements are created and commented;

* An empty contracting authority is created (no data about any CA is supplied); just the necessary for the XML to be validated against the XSD schema;

* An empty economic operator is created (no data about any EO is supplied); just the necessary for the XML to be validated against the XSD schema;

* A `cac:TenderingCriterionResponse` per `cac:TenderingCriterionProperty` in the ESPD Request document is created with 'dummy' values. The `cac:ResponseValue` elements are of the data type expected as specified in the ESPD Request `cac:TenderingCriterionProperty/cac:ValueDataTypeCode` element.

The following feature *is NOT implemented* in the first set of transformation XSL-T style-sheet (`BASIC-ESPDRequest-Annotated-V2.1.1.xslt` and `EXTENDED-ESPDRequest-Annotated-V2.1.1.xslt`):

* The Criteria from the ESPD Request *are not* copied in the ESPD Response document. but the XML examples in the link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.1.1/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/xml[xml folder] do.
