=== Context
==== The Directive 2014/24/EU and the ESPD

Article 59 of the new Public Procurement Directive 2014/24/EC (henceforth ''the Directive'') introduced a new concept, 
the European Single Procurement Document (ESPD) which is a self-declaration document intended for preliminary evidence 
in a public procurement procedure. By mapping out equivalent certificates between MS, the ESPD replaces certificates issued 
by public authorities or a third party involved in a procedure. It is thus a valuable facilitator for cross-border participation 
of a greater number of potential operators in public procurement procedures and a valuable tool for integrating the European Single Market.

==== The ESPD Service
In order to make full use of the ESPD concept, the European Commission has established an on-line service available for both suppliers and buyers. 
The main objective of the ESPD is to reduce the administrative burden and lead to considerable simplification of participation in public 
procurement procedures for buyers and suppliers. The service will reduce that burden by removing the need to produce a substantial number 
of certificates and documentation related to exclusion and selection criteria. This will answer to obstacles reported by many suppliers and 
especially SMEs. 

The ESPD Service is currently in version 1.0 and can be accessed at this URL: https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/espd/.

==== The electronic and structured ESPD XML documents
The ESPD Service was designed to provide the ESPD in a machine-readable structured format that will help solutions all over Europe to be interoperable. Aiming at this objective, DG GROW has developed a data model and artefacts.footnote:[E.g. XSD schemas and validation mechanisms.] for the exchange of the ESPD between any Procurement 
stakeholder's system. This document illustrates in detail how to use these artefacts in compliance with the Directive.

The ESPD Service allows the Contracting Authorities (CA) and the Economic Operators (EO) to edit, import or export (and share) two types of electronic documents:

. The ESPDRequest, a document that is sent by the Contracting Authorities to the Economic Operators;
. The ESPDResponse, the document that is filled-in by the Economic Operators stating whether they fulfil or not the criteria required 
in the ESPDRequest, and providing the sources where evidences can be obtained to prove that the criteria are met by this EO.

As shown in the use case diagram below, the ESPD Documents are at the very core of the ESPD Service:
