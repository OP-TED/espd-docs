The index and structure of this annex are very similar to the original document, and content has been updated to the lastest ESPD-EDM version.

* The link to the updated link:https://docs.ted.europa.eu/ESPD-EDM/latest/_attachments/ESPD_CM_html/index.html[conceptual model] is provided.

== ESPD-EDM v3.1.1

*  The Open User Community has requested a patch release (ESPD-EDM v3.1.1) with some bug fixes. The ESPD Team is working on it, and it is planned to be released in the beginning of February.

* The scope of the patch release is presented, with the list of GitHub issues that will be included in the release. (_Note: GitHub issues 340, 374 and 378 will also be included in the patch release._)

== ESPD-EDM v4.0.0

*  A major release is scheduled for the end of March of 2023 (ESPD-EDM v4.0.0).

* The scope of the major release is presented, with the list of GitHub issues that will be included in the release.

== GitHub issues

* The list of the GitHub issues closed since the last OUC meeting (19 issues) is presented.

* Currently, there are 17 open GitHub issues. The ESPD Team is working on 9 of them; for the rest, there is a dependency on third parties such as the eCertis Team or the eForms Team.

* link:https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/issues/362[GitHub issue #362] (SC-References: performance of works / deliveries / services of the specified type). Currently, requirements are not explicitly linked with questions, question groups or question subgroups. The ESPD Team will review this issue in detail and provide a solution proposal in a future OUC meeting. This issue will not be included in ESPD-EDM v4.0.0.

== Next meetings

* *Next OUC meetings*: 
** 23 February 2023, 10.00 – 11.30
** 23 March 2023, 10.00 – 11.30

* Participants are invited to share their experiences and issues related to the ESPD in future OUC meetings

== Any other business

* *Changes in the Criterion excel file*. The taxonomy is being fine-tuned and adapted to the replacement of UUIDs, but the general structure and contents of the file will not change in ESPD-EDM v4.0.0 (except mistakes that will be corrected in the structure of the elements). The new version of the excel file that is being updated is showed for a better understanding. Before presenting it to the OUC, the file(s) will also be shared with a small group of users for discussion and for a better understanding.

* *Scope of patch release ESPD-EDM v3.1.1*. The patch release will only include fixes to ESPD-EDM v3 (no improvements or new requirements). No more patch releases are expected before the major release. Further changes will be tackled in v4 or future ESPD-EDM releases.

* link:https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/issues/340[GitHub issue #340] (General yearly turnover - differences in taxonomy and mock-ups from ESPD-EDM) has been reopened and will be reviewed in detail by the ESPD Team to assess the feasibility of including it in the patch release ESPD-EDM v3.1.1. (_Note: GitHub issues 340 will finally be included in the patch release ESPD-EDM v3.1.1._)

* *Management of releases*. It is difficult for implementors to cope with many ESPD-EDM versions. It is agreed that, before a new version is in production, there is a pilot with a standstill period so users can test and eventual issues can be fixed before the actual release, in order to minimize the need of future patch releases.
