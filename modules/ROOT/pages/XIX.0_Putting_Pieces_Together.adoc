== IX Putting pieces together

The ESPD-EDM specification, notably regarding the SELF-CONTAINED ESPD, defines different complex sets of data that are
scattered in distant locations of the corresponding XML instance.

Consequently, implementors of software dealing with the ESPD XML instances may have a hard time to identify what needs
to go in the XML instance and where. This is the case of, specifically, the data related to three topics:
1) economic operators, 2) lots, and 3) weights.

To help implementors understand these topics and how to deal with them, the sub-sections of this chapter
illustrate how to put together the different sets of data related to each topic with abundant figures and comments.
