=== IX.1 All about lots

When a procurement procedure is divided in Lots not all the selection criteria apply to all Lots, i.e. some
Lots need to be linked to specific criteria.

In the SELF-CONTAINED ESPD-EDM specification, instead of defining criteria per each Lot, it is for the criterion to
specify to which Lots it applies.

To link a criterion with one or more Lots, the ESPD-EDM uses a GROUP (or SUBGROUP) of REQUIREMENT(s), where each REQUIREMENT
specifies the identifier of each Lot that is affected by the criterion. The figures below show how this is represented
in the four different criteria data structures listed above (''Suitability'', ''Professional risk indemnity'',
''Other economic or financial requirements'' and ''References'').

For more complete examples on how the SELF-CONTAINED ESPD-Request specifies these criteria see the
sub-sections
link:#vi-2-2-self-contained-suitability-enrolments[VI.2.2 Self-contained suitability (enrolments)],
link:#vi-6-2-self-contained-risk-indemnity-insurance[Self-contained risk indemnity insurance],
link:#vi-7-2-self-contained-other-economic-or-financial-requirements[VI.7.2 Self-contained other economic or financial requirements], and
link:#vi-8-2-self-contained-references[VI.8.2 Self-contained references].

The folder link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.1.0/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/xml[dist/xml] also contains
complete XML instances of both REGULATED and SELF-CONTAINED ESPD-Request and ESPD-Response documents.

The *REGULATED* ESPD documents can only define the Lots into which the procedure is divided into and the Lots to which the
economic operator tenders to. The maximum expressivity of information requirements related to Lots is only possible in
the *SELF-CONTAINED* ESPD documents.

Therefore this section focuses only the SELF-CONTAINED ESPD-Response document.

==== Lots: general information requirement check-list

. *Criteria with references to Lots*: The current design of the UBL-2.2 `cac:TenderingCriterion` allows
 referencing Lots for any type of Criteria. However
the current version of the ESPD-EDM only identifies this need in a reduced set of Selection Criteria (see the
link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/blob/2.1.0/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/xlsx/ESPD-CriteriaTaxonomy-SELFCONTAINED-V2.1.0.xlsx[Criteria Taxonomy spread-sheets]
for more details, like the Criterion description, UUID, Code, etc.):

    ** *Suitability I*
    *** Criterion #25 - Enrolment in a relevant professional register
    *** Criterion #26 - Enrolment in a trade register
    *** Criterion #27 - For service contracts: authorisation of particular organisation needed
    *** Criterion #28 - For service contracts: membership of particular organisation needed

    ** *Risk insurance*
    *** Criterion #35 - Professional risk indemnity insurance

    ** *Other economic or financial requirements*
    *** Criterion #36 -Other economic or financial requirements

    ** *References*
    *** Criterion #37 - For works contracts: performance of works of the specified type
    *** Criterion #38 - For supply contracts: performance of deliveries of the specified type
    *** Criterion #39 - For service contracts: performance of services of the specified type

. *Order of occurrence*: The table below presents the different ''blocks'' of data related to Lots in the sequence
they must occur in the ESPD-Response. The aim of this table is help implementors identify the type of data structure,
what it is used for, where to locate its definition (in the UBL-2.2 XSD Schema and the Criteria Taxonomy spread-sheet),
and which comes first and which goes after (i.e. how they are sequenced).

.Order of occurrence of the different blocks of data related to Lots
[cols="<1,<1,<2,<2,<2"]
|===
|*NÂº*|*Data Element*|*Description*|*Location*|*Rules*
|1
|*Procurement Procedure Lots*
|The Lots into which the procurement procedure has been divided into.
|At the root of the QualificationApplicationResponse document, in the element `/cac:ProcurementProjectLot`
|Only the `cbc:ID` (the identifier of the lot) is required. This set of data is common to all the ESPD-Request and
ESPD-Response documents about procedures divided into lots;

|2
|*Criterion ''CA Lots''*
|Requirements by the CA about the submission of tenders when the procedure is divided into Lots.
|Inside a ''false'' criterion data structure C#64 ''*CA Lots*'' (CRITERION.OTHER.CA_DATA.LOTS_SUBMISSION)
|The data provided herein by the CA must be coherent amongst themselves and with the Lots into which the procedure
is divided into. This set of data is common to all the ESPD-Request and ESPD-Response documents about procedures
divided into lots;

|3
|*Criterion ''Lots the EO tenders to''*
|The Lots to which the economic operator tenders
|Inside a UBL-2.2 element `cac:TenderingCriterion`. This criterion has been defined by the ESPD-EDM (see
criterion #62 ''*Lots the EO tenders to*''. This criterion must occur just after `cac:ProcurementProjectLot`
|The Lots specified by the EO in its response must be coherent with the list of Lots specified by the CA (e.g. if the
CA has specified 5 Lots, the EO cannot tender to a ''Lot6'' (see row 1 of this table). This set of data is common to
all the ESPD-Request and ESPD-Response documents about procedures divided into lots;

|4
|*CA's REQUIREMENT(s) and QUESTION(s) linked to specific Lots*
|One or more REQUERIMENT(s) and QUESTION(s) linking one criterion to the lots to which it applies (see XML examples)
|Inside a specific criterion, e.g. REQUIREMENTs defined in the ''Suitability'', ''Professional risk insurance'', ''Other economic
or financial requirements'' and ''References criteria''
|The Lots specified by the CA inside one REQUIREMENT must be coherent with the list of Lots into which the
procurement procedure is divided into (see row 1 or this table)

|5
|*EO's response on its Lots*
|List of the Lot Identifiers to which the EO tenders to
|Inside `/cac:TenderingCriterionResponse/cac:ResponseValue` (as `cbc:ResponseID`)
|The Lot identifiers provided by the EO must be coherent with the ones it (the EO) tenders to (see row 2 of this table)
and with 1) the ones into which the procedure is divided into, and 2) the ones the CA has specified in the REQUIREMENT(s)
