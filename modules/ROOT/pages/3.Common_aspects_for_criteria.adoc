|===

The ESPD-EDM defined a flexible structure to express data about criteria. Based on this structure UBL-2.3 defined in turn the component cac:TenderingCriterion, which is used in ESPD-EDM V3.0.0 to implement the XML objects for exclusion and selection criteria.

The UML diagram below provides a graphic view of the QualificationApplicationRequest document with the complete structure for the cac:TenderingCriterion component (cf. section on the ESPD Response, further on this guide, to understand how the QualificationApplicationResponse deals with Criteria).
