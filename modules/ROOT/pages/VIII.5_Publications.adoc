=== VIII.5 Reference to publications and to the ESPD Request

[cols="<1,<5"]
|===
|*REQUIREMENT*
|*The economic operator must include int its ESPD Response document the information from the ESPD Request about the official journals or gazettes where the procurement procedure is announced. For procurement projects above the threshold it is compulsory to refer to the Contract Notice published in http://ted.europa.eu/TED/misc/chooseLanguage.do[TED] by the contracting authority.*
|===

For EU and national publications that need to be included in the ESPD Response sSee the section "III.4 EU and national publications" where this information is presented in detail and illustrated with examples.

[cols="<1,<5"]
|===
|*REQUIREMENT*
|*The economic operator must include in its ESPD Response document a reference to the ESPD Request. For this, the values of the two identifiers `cbc:ID` and `cbc:UUID` of the ESPD Request must be used as the values for the `cbc:ID` and `cbc:UUID` in the ESPD Response cac:AdditionalDocumentReference (to refer to that ESDP Request).*
|===

Thus the ESPD Response must also make reference to the ESPD Request that is being responded by the economic operator. The XSD diagram below shows (in blue) which elements are expected for this reference. See also the list of expected elements (and rules) and the XML example beneath the XSD diagram.

.Elements expected to reference the ESPD Request from the ESPD Response

If the contracting authority publishes the ESPD Request on a public journal, the economic operator must specify the URI from where the ESPD Response was downloaded to draft its ESPD Response (see for instance how this is done for the publications on the TED or national journals; and see also the XML example below).  

This URI should be specified in the field `cac:AdditionalDocumentReference/cac:Attachment/cac:ExternalRefernce/cbc:URI`:

.URI of the ESPD Request
image::Reference_To_ESPDRequest_URI.png[Reference to ESPD Request, alt="Reference to ESPD Request", align="center"]

In the ESPD Response you may also add references to:

* Evidences that are global for the whole Response. This is not recommended though. Evidences should be as much particular of the Criterion as possible.

* Other documents, e.g. maps, diagrams, or descriptive documents to complement the references about works, supplies or services.

*Rule*: If available in the referenced document place here the time of publication by the contracting authority.

|===

Beware that the ESPD document does not embed the content of referenced documents but instead make a reference to its source. Thus the class DocumentReference aggregates a `cac:Attachment`class that allows for making reference to an external source of the content, which is the preferred way in the ESPD-EDM (see XSD schema above).

In the case of the reference to the ESPD Request from the ESPD Response, the only data expected here is the URI where the ESPD Request XML instance was published:


.External Reference
[cols="<1,<4"]
|===
|*Component name*:| cac:ExternalReference
|*Definition*:|A reference to the authentic source of content of this document.
|*File*:|dist/common/xsdrt/UBL-CommonAggregateComponents-Pre-award.xsd
|*Path*:|/QualificationApplicationResponse/cac:AdditionalReferenceDocument/cac:Attachment/cac:ExternalReference
|*Context of use*:|Reference to the URI location where the ESPD Request XML instance can be downloaded from.

*Rule*: If the document exists at a remote location, then the value should be the URL pointing to the document.
