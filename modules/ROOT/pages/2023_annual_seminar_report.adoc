=== 3.1. Introduction

The main milestones since December 2022 were presented. These steps
cover three minor versions of the ESPD-EDM (v3.1.0, v3.2.0, v3.3.0), as
well as the candidate mayor (v4.0.0-rc) that is planned to be released
in the second quarter of 2024.

Updated statistics (form mid-2023) about the versions of the ESPD-EDM
used across Europe are presented.

A summary of the involvement and participation of the Open User
Community through both the Open User Community meetings and the GitHub
was provided.

=== 3.2. ESPD-EDM v3 – from Q4 2022 to Q3 2023

The main updates included in the minor releases of the ESPD-EDM (v3.1.0: December 2022, v3.2.0: May 2023 and v3.3.0: July 2023) were briefly presented together with the related GitHub issues:

* Occupation code list (ESCO):

** The current technical code list is replaced by
the https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/dataset/-/resource?uri=http://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/occupation[[.underline]#Occupation code list#] published in EU Vocabularies (20220615-0) with the updated values from ESCO
(https://esco.ec.europa.eu/[[.underline]#Multilingualclassification of European Skills&#44; Competences&#44; Qualifications and Occupations#])

** The ESPD-EDM v3.1.0 includes the gc generated and published on June 2022
by EU Vocabularies and maintains the metadata on the repository; the
validation rules have been updated accordingly

** Removal of the option “Other occupations” from the data structure and documentation, since this code list does not include the code "0000.0“: other occupations, which was a customisation in the technical code list

* Corrections in code lists:

** Data Type: date format in code list Criterion

** Financial ratio type: inconsistency between the language label and the actual language

* Corrections in the data structure:

** Data misplacement in several lines in Criteria 35, 52 and 53

** Incorrect or missing cardinalities

** Incorrect use of the UUID

** New requirement within a requirement group to show the number of fiscal years to be covered and the threshold

* Schematron rules

** Incorrect validation related to the ProfileID version, rule deletion

* SubCriterion

** Documentation update to show how it should be used

* Short Tag Name and Implicit Numbering

** Documentation update and new section added with two figures

* ESPD Test Cases Mapping Documentation:

** For ESPD-EDM v2, the document “ESPD Test Cases Mapping” was provided with detailed information regarding business rules

** In https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/issues/331[[.underline]#GitHub issue #331#] it was reported that this document was a helpful tool for technical implementation (as it contained detailed information regarding business rules) and was requested a similar document for v3

** A simplified version of the ESPD Test Cases Mapping Documentation was elaborated and provided in Annex IV in the Technical Handbook for
ESPD-EDM v3.1.0. The link to the https://docs.ted.europa.eu/ESPD-EDM/latest/xml_technical_handbook.html#business-rules-guide[Annex IV] Business Rules Guide was provided

* Corrections to the data structure:

* Typos

* UUDs

* Update of mock ups

* Update of cardinalities

** Removal of CustomizationID and ProfileID elements from ESPD artefacts

** Re-introduction of the element ProcedureCode in the UML conceptual mode

** Correction of date and time formats

** Correction of several listId values and code lists updates

** Percentage translation in ESPD XML files 


The link to the last https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/releases/tag/v3.3.0[[.underline]#release tag#] which includes all changes and to the https://docs.ted.europa.eu/ESPD-EDM/3.3.0/index.html[documentation] were
provided.

=== 3.3. ESPD-EDM v3.3.0 implementation – Interproc consortium

Interproc consortium, started the implementation of the ESPD-EDM version
3.3.0 during 2023. The consortium has created several artifacts and
supported the implementation of the ESPD in several systems. Interproc
has been going during this year through the whole process of eTendering,
not only the ESPD implementation and they have been concentrated into
adapting to and implementing the eForms.

The consortium colleagues kindly shared their implementation of version
3 and its subversions in their ESPD platforms during a live presentation
with the Open User Community during this Annual seminar. The demo
includes the creation of a Request and of a Response using two different ESPD services, one by the contracting authority and a second one by the
economic operator.

Also some expectations of what version 4.0.0 should cover were provided:

* Move on with the xml path for the UUID logic to allow reuse of ESPD
responses between tenders without mixin answers. This has been discussed
during 2023 with the OUC
* Support of distinct requirements under the same criteria when using
lots.

In parallel the pending enhancements on eCertis side should be available
to support multiple purely national exclusion grounds.

For a complete overview the

(chapter 1:00:29)

It is under consideration and discussion to publish the code as open
source.

=== 3.4. ESPD-EDM v4.0.0 (2024)

After the break the main updates that will be included in the major
release v4.0.0, scheduled for Q2 2024, were presented, together with the
related GitHub issues:

* Different requirements for different lots:

** Correction of an issue so different requirements can be set for
different lots within a selection criterion (the current technical
implementation in ESPD-EDM v3 does not allow multiple and different
requirement per lot)

* Purely National Exclusion Grounds:

** Creation of an xml file test that includes question subgroup with
multiple cardinality "1..n" replicated twice, allowing to provide more than one Purely National Exclusion Ground criterion

** Update of the Data Structure, aimed at a more natural (semantic) way of providing evidences, the whole Criteria Excel file (not only Purely National Exclusion Grounds)

* Update of the current UUID for repeatable subgroups:

** Update excel criterion files and generation of xml samples files

** XSLT updates: transformation from Excel to XML ESPD

* Corrections in code lists:

** Revision of description texts to ensure consistency between eCertis and the Taxonomy

** Correction of a duplicated code in the occupations code list and other possible ESCO updates

* Validation rules:

** Create validation rules for mandatory fields

** Create validation rules for all ESPD code lists


* UUIDs replacement by XML Path Like ID as discussed during 2023:

** The *problem statement*: Currently, questions in criteria need to be instantiated for each procurement procedure instead of reusing criteria from earlier procurement procedures

** The *business requirements*:

*** Ensure the connection for each criterion between ESPD Request and
Response

*** Ensure reusability of criteria both in the Request and the Response across procurement procedures

*** Facilitate traceability and The Once-Only Principle (TOOP).

** The *proposed solution*: Reduce the randomness on the ESPD by no longer using dynamic UUIDs and defining fixed identifiers for requirements and questions (identifiers are already fixed for criteria):

** UUIDs will be replaced by a pre-defined short tag name for each element and a numbering according to the position within the tree structure, providing a path to a target criterion element. The new pattern focuses on the alignment of *tags, syntax readability and indexing* separation:

image:image1.png[Interfaz de usuario gráfica, Texto Descripción generada automáticamente,width=305,height=49]


* The mapping between the criterion element short tag name proposed, the criterion element, and the UBL element, was provided. Several examples for the management of questions and the management of requirements were provided for a better understanding.


* Only the UUID of the criteria, which is a fixed UUID, will be preserved as a link to eCertis, while UUIDs for question groups and subgroups, requirements and questions, will be replaced.

* The VBA Scripts used for the generation the xml path like ids and XSLT updates were presented.

* The link to resulting criterion files is provided
https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/tree/v4.0.0-uuid/criterion 


* A summary of the implications of implementing this solution was
provided, as well as the main expected benefits:

** The link between an ESPD Request and its related ESPD Responses (one or several) will be consistent

** Same structures will use the same identifier

** There will no ambiguity when addressing structures represented by the same identifier

** It will be possible to reuse the same data structure in different
procedures

** It will be possible to easily read and map ESPD Responses

** It will be possible to reuse content of the ESPD when requirements are compatible

It is mentioned that the new mayor release 4.0.0 will be a candidate
release for which users can provide comments during a period of time to be agreed before it becomes a final release. Some users requested a comment’s period of six months, this will discussed during 2024.

*Questions and answers*

Q: Will we have a pilot implementation for v 4? One of the main issues during v3 is that there is a template standard but there is no reference implementation since v 1 wg-hre users can see how the implementation should work and to confirm that the standard really works.

A: For the time being there is no room for the ESPD Team to implement a pilot service. GROW and the Publications Office will check the possibilities available to avoid that users start development for v4 from scratch.

=== 3.5. eProcurement Ontology eAccess - ESPD Request

* The eProcurement Ontology (ePO) and the ESPD-EDM teams meet every
Tuesday with other users starting at 14:30 to create the eAccess model following the ESPD.

* The main goal of the Ontology is explained: to provide a common
understanding , which enables the correct input of data in procurement systems. the understanding of exchanged data, data quality.

* The diagrams created during the last months are presented. The process includes the analysis of the already existing concepts in both, Ontology and ESPD models.

* The Request can refer to a Notice and it also concerns a Procedure and from there the diagrams go the the Buyer and the ServiceProvider. It also can go to the Economic Operator but its diagrams will be included in teh Request part (eSubmission)

* The Legislation diagrams are also presented: Legislation is related to a Criterion. The ELI implementation has been chosen for the concepts of the procurement domain. The elements needed for the ESPD Request are presented

* The ePO alignment to Core Criterion and Core Evidence Vocabulary (CCCEV) is presented. This vocabulary has already been implemented in the past in the ePO Core module, these concepts will be attached to the modules that concern the ESPD

* The Requirements and Questions diagrams for eAccess are presented.

* ESPD implementers were invited to contact the ePO or ESPD OP teams to clarify some questions related to the need of using certain elements.

=== 3.6. What’s up, eCertis? An Outlook

The release planning for eCertis was presented:

* 2024.01 – planned for February 2024

* 2024.02 – planned for November 2024

* 2024.03 – planned for December 2024 (maintenance release)

* During the summer eCertis will get in touch with the eCertis com to see how the implementation could go and how to better aligned to eForms and the ESPD.

The way of connecting eCertis, ESPD, eForms (2023) and national systems was presented. Currently they live somehow on their on and the goal is to connect them. The artifact to connect these different elements and tools is already available in EU-Vocabularies: Criterion code list.

A high level view of how the four elements (eCertis, ESPD, eForms and
national systems) can work together is shown in relation to the stages of Planning, Competition, and Result.
