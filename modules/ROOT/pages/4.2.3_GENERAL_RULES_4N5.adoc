.General rule 4: Use of the first Requirement as a ''decision point''
[NOTE]
====
If the Criterion contains a question that needs to be answered with ''yes'' or ''no'' the first Requirement SHOULD be just a sentence requiring to answer ''yes'' or ''no''.
The answer to this Requirement will be considered the answer to the Criterion and a ''decision point'' used to fork between whether to process the data within the group or not.

.General rule 5: Compulsory use of the UUIDs defined by COM
[NOTE]
====
ESPD XML documents intended to be conformant to the ESPD Service MUST use the Universally Unique Identifiers provided by COM for Criterion, RequirementGroup and Requirement. 
These UUIDs are the same as the ones used in e-Certis.footnote:[For the time being e-Certis only contains Criteria.].
