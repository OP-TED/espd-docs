Offering parties participating in a tender can have different roles.

* *Sole Trader*

A Sole Trader is a single economic entity, such as a single person like an IT Consultant or a single business, that operates solely and independently in providing goods and services.

* *Group Leaders and Group Members*

A group leader is a person or business that establishes a supply group consisting of members, all of whom contribute to the supply of the goods and services. The group is collectively responsible for the supply. The group leader performs tasks such as coordinating the admin of the group, being the single contact between the group and the buyer, and collecting and submitting the members' contributions to the bid, including all the ESPD documents.

A group member follows the co-ordination of the group leader, supplying goods and services as per their remit and/ or geographical area.

* *Sub-contractor*

Sub-contractors are economic entities engaged by a group leader or member to supply a function or service independently of the group. They are typically one of many similar companies that could fulfil this function and as such are "not relied on". They liaise only with the requesting EO party.

* *Other Entity relied on*

An entity that is relied on performs a role or a capacity that the group or sole trader relies on to fulfil the selection criteria. They might not provide goods or services, but are relied on for the eligibility of the offering party to tender for the contract. This might be e.g., to boost the turnover of the offering party to a specified threshold level, perform a regulatory or auditory function, supply certificates of quality assurance, supply certificates related to biosecurity for cross border transport (these are just a few).

The following sections show in detail which EO roles are required to complete which answers in an ESPD.
