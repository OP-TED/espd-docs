=== VII.3 ESPD Response cardinalities

As you can see the UBL-2.2 Schema is quite flexible as, except for a few cases practically all the elements are optional.

The ESPD-EDM model, however, adds a few more restrictions regarding the cardinalities. These can be seen in  the diagram below, which presents the ESPD-EDM V2.0.2 structure for the ESPD Response with its own cardinality restrictions. Notice that ESPD-EDM does not change anything else from the UBL-2.2 Schema.

If you compare both figures you will observe that:

. The cardinalities of the root common basic components, such as `cbc:ID`, `cbc:UUID`, `cbc:TendererRole`, `cbc:QualificationApplicationTypeCode`, `ProcedureCode`, and other are different for the ESPD than for UBL-2.2;

. Similarly, the cardinalities of aggregate components like `cac:ContractingParty`, `cac:ProcurementProjectLot` and `cac:TenderingCriterion` are different to the UBL-2.2 ones.

The cardinality constraints added by the ESPD are not defined in the XSD Schema. In order to control these constraints the ESPD-EDM uses http://schematron.com/[ISO Schematron] assertions. The ESPD-EDM V2.0.2 distribution package provides Schematron schemata and CVA files footnote:[CVA files are used for the validation of Codes and Identifiers. See the https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=codelist[OASIS Genericode 1.0] specification and http://www.cranesoftwrights.com/bio/gkholman.htm#summary[CRANE SOFTWRIGHTS] site for more details] for the validation of the XML instances (folder link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.0.2/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/val[_dist/val_]). 

The European Commission (EC) https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/awards_en[ISA2 Programme] provides an https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/itb/description[Interoperability Testbed] where Stakeholders can freely test these validation artefacts.
