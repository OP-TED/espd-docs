==== RepresentativeNaturalPerson

UBL-2.1 defines a component _PowerOfAttorney_ with that is a good container for the main data about a representativefootnote[cac:PowerOfAttorney also aggregates
the cac:AgentParty, where many data about the person can be provided.]. However the ESPD stakeholders 
identified some data requirements that the UBL-2.1 component does not cater for; namely the role of the person (e.g. type of representation) and the 
country where this person is registered (i.e. in a civil base register).

The XSD diagram and table below show the details about the class EconomicOperatorParty:

===== Power of attorney
The ESPD reuses only a small part of the class cac:PowerOfAttorney defined in UBL-2.1, only the component _AgentParty_ and within it the subcomponent _Person_:

From the subcomponent Person, also a rich UBL structure, the ESPD is interested in a small set of elements, namely the name, birth data, and contact data of the
representative, as shown in this example:
