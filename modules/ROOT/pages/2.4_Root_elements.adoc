_A note about the Business Rules identifiers_

From this point on in the document, the tables defining classes and its properties refer frequently to business rules. As stated in the link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1.0-BusinessRules[e-Sens BIS document], "[..] business rules are sets of rules that clarify the content of instances by stating mandatory fields, fixed values (like code lists), dependency between fields in the same object and dependency between different objects".

Information requirement:

Beware that *all theses documents do share the same business rule identifiers* (e.g. tbrxx-yyy for Business Requirement Identifiers in ESPDInt, and BR-Type-Id#n for the Test Cases technical rules).

*Rule scope*: Common (BR-OTH-05, 2.BR-OTH-02)

|*cbc:CustomizationID* |Identifier |1 |Identifies a user-defined customization of UBL for a specific use. link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1-tbr070-001[_tbr070-001_]. a|

*Rule scope*: Common (BR-OTH-02, BR-OTH-06)

|*cbc:ProfileID* |Identifier |0..1 |An identification of the specification containing the total set of rules regarding semantic content, cardinalities and business rules to which the data contained in the instance document conforms. The identification may include the version of the specification as well as any customizations applied. a|
*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1.0-tbr070-002[_tbr070-002_].

*Rule*: Use the value "41". Use also "CEN-BII" for the scheme AgencyID attribute.

*Rule scope*: Common (BR-OTH-07, BR-OTH-02)

|*cbc:ProfileExecutionID* |Identifier |1 |The identification and version of the ESPD Exchange Data Model used to create the to XML instance. The identification may include the exact version of the specification. a|
*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1.0-tbr070-002[_tbr070-002_].

*Rule*: Compulsory use of the CodeList ProfileExecutionID. Use the value "EU-COM-GROW" for th SchemeAgencyID attribute.

*Rule scope*: Common (BR-OTH-01, BR-OTH-01#13, BR-OTH-03)

|*cbc:ID* |Identifier |1 |An identifier for this document, normally generated by the system that creates the ESPD document, or the organisation responsible for the document (e.g. the buyer, e.g. a buyer, or the supplier, e.g. an economic operator). An identifier for this document, normally generated by the system that creates the ESPD document, or the organisation responsible for the document (e.g. the buyer, e.g. a buyer, or the supplier, e.g. an economic operator). The identifier enables positive referencing the document instance for various purposes including referencing between transactions that are part of the same process. a|
*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1.0-tbr070-002[_tbr070-002_].

*Rule*: Compulsory use of schemeAgencyID attribute. Use it to identify the organisation responsible for the document.

*Rule*: It is a good practice to use the CopyIndicator component if the same document is forwarded several times to the same or to different destinations. Use it in combination with the UUID identifier: copies of an ESPD document should be identified with distinct UUIDs.

|*cbc:UUID* |Identifier |1 |A universally unique identifier that can be used to reference this ESPD document instance. a|
*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1.0-tbr070-002[_tbr070-002_].

*Rule*: This UUID will be used to link the ESPD Response to its corresponding ESPD Request (thus its compulsoriness). Copies of a document must be identified with a different UUID. Compulsory use of schemeAgencyID attribute.

*Rule scope*: BR-OTH-02

|*cbc:ContractFolderID* |Identifier |1 |An identifier that is specified by the buyer and used as a reference number for all documents in the procurement process. It is also known as procurement project identifier, procurement reference number or contract folder identifier.

*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1.0-tbr070-007[_tbr070-007_].

*Rule*: Try always to use the reference number issued by the buyer. This information will be provided in eForms using the same cbc:ContractFolderID, therefore the ESPD should include the same identifier in order to link both models, and shall be globally unique.

This number in combination with a registered buyer ID (e.g. the VAT number) results in a *universally unique identifier of the procurement procedure*.

*Rule scope*: BR-SC-10

|*cbc:IssueDate* |Date |1 |Date when the document was issued by the buyer. a|
*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1.0-tbr070-002[_tbr070-002_].

*Rule*: Format "YYYY-MM-DD".

|*cbc:IssueTime* |Time |0..1 |Time when the document was issued by the buyer. a|
*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1.0-tbr070-002[_tbr070-002_].

*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1.0-tbr070-014[_tbr070-014_].

*Rule*: None

|*cbc:ProcedureCode* |Code |0..1 |The type of the procurement administrative procedure according to the EU Directives. a|
*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1.0-tbr070-007[_tbr070-007_].

*Rule*: For the ESPD V3.0.0, this information will be linked to eForms. And ESPD should include the same procedure code as the one stated in eForms notices.

|*cac:ContractingParty* |Associated class |1 |The buyer or contracting entity who is buying supplies, services or public works using a tendering procedure as described in the applicable directive (Directives 2014/24/EU, 2014/25/EU). a|

*Rule*: UBL-2.3 defines multiple cardinality ContractingParties presumably to allow *joint procurements*. However the ESPD only expects data about one buyer. The decision was made that in case of joint procurement the data collected in the ESPD would be about *the leader* of the joint procurement procedure.

In ESPD v3.0.0 the contracting party information will come from eForms. Which also uses cac:ContractingParty to specify the information about buyer.

|*cac:ProcurementProject* |Associated class |0..1 |An overall definition of the procurement procedure. |This information is not required for the ESPD 3.0.0 since the information related to the procedure will come from eForms.
|*cac:ProcurementProjectLot* |Associated class |0..1 |One of the procurement project lots into which this contract can be divided. a|
*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1.0-tbr070-008[_tbr70-008_].

*Rule*: If there is only one single procurement project lot specified, the ESPD refers then to a procurement procedure a lots, as eForms does.

|*cac:TenderingCriterion* |Associated class |1..n |A tendering criterion describes a rule or a condition that is used by the contracting body to evaluate and compare tenders by economic operators and which will be used for the exclusion and the selection of candidates to the award decision. a|
*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1.0-tbr70-003[_tbr70-003, tbr70-009_].

*Rule*: (see examples further below in this document)

|*cac:AdditionalDocumentReference* |Associated class |0..n |A reference to an additional document associated with this document. a|
*Information Requirement*: link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1.0-tbr70-007[_tbr70-007_].

*Rule*: *For procurement procedures above the threshold it is compulsory to make reference to the Contract Notice of the procedure published in TED*. See section "Reference to the Contract Notice" for a complete example.
