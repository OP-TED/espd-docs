== Purpose

This guide explains how Business Rules are implemented, and which ones apply in each case. The guide can be used to:

* Identify the business rules, and describe and map the Schematron rules with UBL-2.3 XSD, for each test case;
* Validate the criteria taxonomy.

=== Input Documents

_Table 1: List of Input documents_

=== Process

The process to identify the business rules is the following one:

[arabic]
. *List the test cases ID and test case rule ID* from [RD01]. These rules are common among the test cases; which means that each rule ID must have a unique identifier within the current document (Mapping Rule ID).
. For each *Mapping Rule ID*:
[loweralpha]
.. Map each of the rules to UBL-2.3 XSD as description;
.. Identify the whole path within UBL-2.3 XSD;
.. List the business rules coming from the XML implementation guide [RD02] and those ones coming from ESPD_TestCases [RD01].
. Identify the rules coming from Data Structures Regulated spreadsheet [RD03] and Self-contained [RD04].
. Identify other rules coming from the XML implementation guide [RD02].

=== Tables

The process described above uses the following auxiliary tables.

[arabic]
. Identification of the test cases from [RD01] and mapping it into the UBL-2.3 XSD.

[width="100%",cols="22%,11%,11%,24%,32%",options="header",]
|===
|*Pre-conditions (from [RD01])* | | | |
|XSD Schema | a|
XSD filename. It could be ESPD request or ESPD response.

UBL-QualificationApplicationRequest-2.2-Pre-award.xsd (ESPD Request) or UBL-QualificationApplicationResponse-2.2-Pre-award.xsd (ESPD Response).

| |
|Regulated or Self-contained ESPD | |/cbc:QualificationApplicationTypeCode value, either REGULATED or SELFCONTAINED according to QualificationApplicationType code list. | |
|Divided into lots | |Number of lots in the current test case (/cac:ProcurementProjectLot /cbc:ID). | |
|Two-phased procedure | |Type of procedure, whether single-phased (OPEN) or two-phased procedure (different to OPEN) (/cbc:ProcedureCode). | |

|*List of rules (they apply when the previous conditions are met)* | | | |
|*Rule ID* |*Rule* | |*Scenario ID* |*Scenarios*
|Test Case Rule ID (from [RD01]) and Mapping Rule ID |Description of the rule and mapping to Mapping Rule ID (current document) | |Scenario ID (from [RD01]) and Mapping Scenario ID |Description of the scenario and mapping to Mapping Scenario ID (current document)
|===

_Table 2: Test Case ID example_

[arabic, start=2]
. For each of the rules identified in document [RD01], the following table describes its mapping in natural language:

[width="100%",cols="36%,13%,51%",options="header",]
|===
|*Mapping Rule ID* | |
|Test Case Rule ID |Identifier of the Rule from [RD01] |
|Rule description |Description of the business rule |
|Mapping description |Description of the mapping between the rule and the XSD |
|XSD Path |UB-2.2 XSD path |
|XSD Business Rule description | |XSD Business Rule Schematron
|Description of the business rule, which applies the XSD (see document [RD02]) | a|
Description of the business rule from Schematron point of view.

Business rules can be classified as WARNING (user information) or ERROR (fatal error which stops the validation).
