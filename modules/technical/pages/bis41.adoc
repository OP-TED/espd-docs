= Business Interoperability Interfaces for public procurement in Europe — Profile BII41 — European Single Procurement Document (ESPD)

== Introduction

The CEN BII Workshop was established in May 2007 with the objective of
harmonising electronic public procurement in Europe. The BII Workshop is standardisation initiative within CEN (European Committee for
Standardisation). It provides a framework for interoperability in
pan-European electronic transactions expressed as a set of technical
specifications ("Profiles"). Profiles are designed to facilitate
effective public e-procurement based on a modular approach for
implementation, with a focus on global interoperability.

BII Profiles can be seen as “agreements” on message contents and
business processes. The profile descriptions focus on the core
information elements that typically cater to the majority of user
requirements applicable across Europe and lower the need for detailed
bilateral agreements between the trading partners.

More information about the BII initiative can be found in CWA 1234:2015nd on http://www.cenbii.eu[www.cenbii.eu].

== Scope

=== Introduction

Profile BII41 ESPD describes a process providing electronic messaging
support for requesting and providing a European Single Procurement
Document (ESPD). As stated in Art. 59 of the directive 2014/24/EU of the
European Parliament and of the Council, the ESPD is a self-declaration
by economic operators providing preliminary evidence replacing the
certificates issued by public authorities or third parties. Its
objective is to reduce the administrative burden arising from the
requirement to produce a substantial number of certificates or other
documents related to exclusion and selection criteria. It is for the
business process of tendering in a pre-awarding phase. The ESPD may be
requested by a contracting authority of the economic operator, by a
(potential) main contractor of its subcontractors or partner contractors
in a consortium, or by a contractor to be generated by an ESPD service
provider.

The key aspects covered by this profile are:

* A contracting authority can use this profile to request the ESPD of an
economic operator.
* An economic operator can use this profile to request the ESPD of
subcontractors or of other economic operators in a consortium according
to specifications in Call for Tender documents.
* The profile can be used by an economic operator to request a service
provider to assemble its ESPD according to specifications in Call for
Tender documents.
* The ESPD transactions are specific to a particular call for tenders.
* The ESPD can be used for qualification in a restricted procedure or
for tendering in an open procedure. Qualification through providing a
Virtual Company Dossier or through other Qualification profiles
containing the necessary evidence documents, as well as tendering are
out of the scope of this profile.

The open procedure is described in profile BII37, the restricted
procedure in profile BII39.

=== Goals

The main business benefits to be gained by implementing this profile are:

[width="100%",cols="12%,88%",options="header",]
|===
|*ID* |*Description*
|G41-001 |The ESPD allows the contracting body to install a systematic
qualification process, with considerable simplification for the benefit
of both contracting authorities and economic operators.

|G41-002 |Economic operators can automatically generate an ESPD with the
support of an ESPD service according to the criteria set out in a call
for tender.

|G41-003 |Main contractors can easily request subcontractors or partner
contractors in consortia to provide their ESPDs.

|G41-004 |The ESPD allows for a semi-automated and simple process to
prove qualification of economic operators in tendering procedures
through self-declarations.
|===

=== Business environment

==== Introduction

The intended scope for this profile includes public procurement, but the
profile may also be used in Business to Business (B2B) relations.

This profile is intended to support transmission of electronic documents
for processing in (semi-)automated processes. The legal requirements
that were taken into account are requirements from European legislation,
in particular the EU directives, mentioned in section 6 of this profile.

The transactions, specified in this profile are intended to be exchanged
between the tendering systems of economic operators and contracting
bodies. This means that it is expected that the parties have connected
their systems to the internet, and that they have middleware in place to
enable them to send and receive the transactions in a secure way, using an agreed syntax.

The content model of the transactions can also be used in procurement
platforms or portals, so that these platforms as well as procurement
systems of economic operators and contracting bodies are based on the
same information and process models, which makes them more
interoperable. Even if platforms are not technically interoperable, the
content model facilitates understanding the tendering documents and to
participate in the tendering process.

==== Tendering procedures

Individual pre-award processes can be put in place using different
procedures, depending on the value and the type of the contract to be awarded, on the legal nature of the contracting body and on specific
member state national legislation (Directive 2014/24/EU art. 26). In
open procedures, any economic operator can access the tender documents
(including the call for tenders) and submit a tender before the time
expires, without subscribing for interest and without any previous assessment of their capabilities. In restricted and negotiated
procedures and in a competitive dialogue the interested economic
operators must submit a request to participate in order to be invited in
the tendering process by the contracting body. When the contracting body
has published a notice, the interested economic operators may subscribe
to obtain tendering information using profile BII46. Negotiated
procedures require sending the invitation to tender (profile BII52) to
identified candidates.
Article 26 to 32 from Directive 2014/24/EU and article 43 to 50 from
Directive 2014/25/EU describe the different tendering procedures that
can be used by contracting bodies. For the purpose of electronic
tendering, some of these procedures have been described in BII profiles
BII37 (open procedure) and BII39 (restricted procedure). These profiles are included in CWA 3456 parts 106 and 108.

Official notification through publishing bodies is part of many
procedures. eNotification covers the electronic transfer of electronic
notices for publication and dissemination services with the ultimate aim
of opening market opportunities. Profiles BII14 Prior Information
Notice, BII10 Contract Notice and BII43 Contract Award Notice describe
the exchange of a notice between a contracting body or his
representative and a publisher. Profile BII61 describes the exchange of
notices between publishers. The process by which notices can be searched
for on a given platform are described in profiles BII62 Exchange of
Notice Metadata and BII45 Search Notices. These profiles are included in
CWA 2345.

=== Key Examples

==== *Example 1*
 contracting body from Germany using the eTendering platform e-Vergabe
starts to prepare a tendering procedure, because it wants to buy goods
from any European supplier. First, it starts to prepare the relevant
documents in particular the tender notice and call for tender in any
local format (e.g. x-Vergabe9. As part of this process, the contracting
body specifies the qualification criteria in the form of a structured
ESPD Template, according to pre-defined codes, which need to be proven
by economic operators applying for the contract. The contracting body adds the standardised qualification criteria to the tender notice and/or
call for tender, or it includes the ESPD Template as an attachment to
the previous.
After having searched for interesting call for tenders across Europe,
having received an invitation to the call for tender , or having
received a notification from a platform where the economic operator is
subscribed to (e.g. TED), an economic operator from the Netherlands
subscribed interest (using TenderNed as his or her tendering platform to
prepare the bid) and received the tender documents, including
qualification criteria. In this ESPD profile, the most relevant document
received is the call for tender including the list of qualification
criteria (as part of the call for tender itself or as attached ESPD
Template). The list of qualification criteria is received in a
standardized, structured format. Besides preparing the content of the
tender in the tendering platform (e.g. TenderNed), the economic operator
opens the ESPD Template received and creates the standardized form
confirming that he/she fulfils all qualification criteria. The economic
operator inserts the finalized ESPD in the Tender Offer and submits it
together with the offer to e-Vergabe (using TenderNed as his/her
client). The contracting body receives the offer in e-Vergabe, including
the ESPD.

==== *Example 2*
long the procedure described in Example 1, the economic operator is not single tenderer. He / she bids in a consortium and has a subcontractor
him- or herself. Hence, the economic operator as main contractor sends a
request from his TenderNed client to the German subcontractor to provide
the ESPD for the tender. The German subcontractor receives the request
via DE-Mail. Furthermore, the economic operator sends a request from his
TenderNed client to the Austrian, Italian and Greek partner contractors
via eDelivery channels to provide their ESPDs for the tender.

The German subcontractor, being located in Berlin, logs in to the ESPD
service provider portal of Auftragsberatungsstelle Brandenburg e.V. He
uploads the ESPD template received, fills and signs the ESPD using the
ESPD service there, and retrieves the filled and signed ESPD from the
portal via download. Afterwards, he sends the ESPD to the main
contractor’s tendering client (TenderNed) via DE-Mail.

The Austrian partner contractor contacts ANKÖ to generate the ESPD. He
uploads the ESPD template received, fills and signs the ESPD using theNKÖ ESPD service, and sends from ANKÖ’s portal the ESPD to the
TenderNed client of the main contractor.

The Italian economic operator uses the ESPD service of the European
Commission (DG-GROW) to generate the ESPD. He uploads the ESPD template
to the portal and fills the data. Then he retrieves the filled ESPD and
sends it via eDelivery to the Dutch main contractor.

The Greek economic operator uses the Greek ESPD service which works
similar to the German one as described before. To deliver the ESPD to
the Dutch economic operator, he uses the eSens eDelivery service.

Finally, the Dutch economic operator adds all received ESPDs to the bid
in the bidder client of TenderNed and submits the bid using eSubmission
profiles of BII, where the ESPDs of all consortium members and
subcontractors are included as attachment.

==== Example 3 

The scope of the scenario is a combination of example 1 and example 2.
However, the contracting body uses a two-stage procedure. The
contracting body makes the same preparations as described in 3.2.1,
except that the procedure is different.

The economic operator, as in example 1, subscribes to the procedure and
receives the ESPD template. As it is a two-stage procedure, only the
submission of the ESPD is required. Accordingly, he requests ESPDs of
his consortium partners and subcontractors, and uses TenderNed to fill
in his own ESPD – see the details described in example 2. Finally, the
economic operator as main contractor submits the package of ESPDs from
his TenderNed client via eDelivery to e-Vergabe.
