The ESPD includes a change regarding how lots are managed. This is the outcome of the alignment with eForms.

In this new version the ESPD will have the following logic:

There will be 1 ESPD request stating the Exclusion Criteria and the Selection Criteria, but with differences respect version 2.1.1. The figure below shows the logic:

_Figure 13. Overview of new lot management approach._

The ESPD Request include exclusion grounds that are general for all the Lots in which the procedure is divided in. However, for Selection Criteria is different since in the procedure is possible to have Lots with different selection criteria. Therefore, in the ESPD request the different Selection Criteria will have to include the reference to the lots which applies. It will be done using the UBL 2.3 cac:ProcurementProjectLotReference that includes cbc:TenderingCriterion.

In Economic Operator's side it is different, as can be read in the image above there will be as many ESPD Response as Lots or Group of Lots the EO wishes to tender for. If the EO wants to participate in three Lots, the EO will need to fill in 3 ESPD Response. For more details on this, please see section ESPD Response.

Please generate an ESPD Request and ESPD Response documents on https://docs.ted.europa.eu/espd-demo/[ESPD Demo Site] to see full example on how Lot Management is implemented.

== Lots identifiers: 

This version of the ESPD changes the form to identify the Lots and Group of Lots taking the eForms format. This changes is done towards the interoperability of both models.

Until version 2.1.1, the lots have been identified with the following structure "Lot1, Lot2, Lot3". With the new approach (eForms) the Lots identifiers will be as follows: (eForms) the Lots identifiers will be as follows:
