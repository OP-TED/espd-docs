|*REQUIREMENT* xref:tbr70_reqs.adoc#list_of_criteria[tbr70-009] |The ESPD request must contain information about the criteria that set the exclusion grounds as stated in directive 2014/24/EU Art. 57 and referred to in directive 2014/25/EU Art. 80 and/or according to national legislation. These should be retrieved from e-Certis.
|===

As suggested in section "Criteria Data Structures" criteria may be grouped in several different categories. The Criterion File is arranged in a tree-like structure with branches and leaves (end nodes), that identify and list these categories of Exclusion criteria (branches), and specific subgroups within each category (leaves).

Each branch in this 'criteria classification' corresponds to one data structure that is identical in all the leaves under that branch. 

See Criterion 1 (C1) in the https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/blob/v4.0.0/criterion/ESPD-criterion.xlsx[Criterion File]

== Convictions

*Information requirement*

See formal requirements related to exclusion grounds in the xref:bis41.adoc[BIS 41 - European Single Procurement Document (Version 2.0.0)], and more specifically *_tbr070-009_*, *_tbr070-004_*, *_tbr070-013_*.

The label ''Convictions'' groups all the criteria with identical data structures classified as:

''participation in a criminal organisation'', ''corruption'', ''fraud'', ''terrorist offences linked to terrorist activities'', ''money laundering or terrorist financing'', ''child labour and other forms of trafficking in human beings''.

[NOTE]
_Note about the ESPD Service_

Initially, the European Commission provided an ESPD service to facilitate member states' adoption of the ESPD. As announced in 2018, on 2 May 2019, the Commissionâ€™s ESPD service was discontinued and members were encouraged to develop their own ESPD services. To benefit fully from an electronic ESPD, integration with national eProcurement services and national databases is necessary. This enables data reusability, default form pre-filling, and data inter-exchange among different databases. In turn, buyers and suppliers would benefit from such integration, making the application of the ESPD easier, and decreasing data errors rates.


=== Data structure

See Criterion 1 (C1) in the https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM/blob/v4.0.0/criterion/ESPD-criterion.xlsx[Criterion File]

[cols=",",options="header",]

. Date of conviction. Mandatory format 'YYYY-MM-DD'
. The reason of convictions. A descriptive text.
. The natural person or legal entity convicted. A text.
. Length of the period of exclusion. A cac:Period will be used in the response by the economic operator. The EO may specify a starting date and an end-date or, alternatively, a text to commenting the length. See XML example in the ESPD Response section.
. If the answer is *No* the QUESTION 'Please describe them' should not be shown.
. Text box to describe the measures to demonstrate the economic operator's reliability.
. A whole group related to one conviction can be repeated multiple times (or deleted).
. If answered as *No* the group of QUESTION(s) relating the online evidence should not be shown. Beware that the ESPD Response behaves totally differently as far as evidence are concerned. The data concerning the evidence in the ESPDRequest document is placed in the ESPD Response document in a component cac:Evidence in a different manner. See the section ESPD Response for more details on this. See also the XML examples.
. The URL where to access the evidence. Will be placed in an element of the object cac:Evidence. See chapter *"6.8 Evidences"*.
. By specifying that the value of the expected data type is an evidence identifier (code EVIDENCE_IDENTIFIER of the Code List ResponseDataType`) the Response will have to contain an evidence supplied in an element of the object cac:Evidence, at the end of the XML Instance. See chapter *"6.8 Evidences"*.
. The issuer party of this evidence (e.g. a base registry). Will be placed in the element cac:Evidence/cac:DocumentReference/cac:Attachment/cac:IssuerParty. Some countries use verification codes associated to evidence. To specify these verification codes you can use the Evidence ID, as in the end the code identifies uniquely the Evidence in the issuer system (see this XML example, look for 'Verification code' inside the example, bullet number 6).
. National criterion defined by the MS in e-Certis (this example corresponds to Finland) related to the EU criterion on this conviction.
. An additional specification for this national criterion, in this case related to the evidence that will be required by this Member State.
. UUID supplied by e-Certis. See also the criterion spread-sheet.
. Exclusion criteria taxonomy code defined in the criterion spread-sheet.
. Compulsory name and description for the criterion as defined in e-Certis. See also link:{url-tree}/codelists/ESPD-criterion.xlsx[ESPD-criterion spreadsheet]. Beware that UBL-2.3 allows '0..n' description lines!
. This property is a caption, a mere 'label'. See Code List link:{url-tree}/codelists/gc/CriterionElementType.gc[CriterionElementType] for the complete list of possible options. Beware that when a property is of type CAPTION the cbc:ValueDataType must be set to NONE.
. As the property is a CAPTION no response is expected from the economic operator. See Code List 'ResponseDataType' for the complete list of possible options.
. Notice that in the ESPD Request the criterion properties never use its element cbc:Name.
. EU legislation data related to this criterion. Notice that all the textual fields have multiple cardinality and *may* specify the language (attribute languageID. This can be used to express the same content in different languages. No language specified defaults to en (English).
. The complete title as published in Eurlex or in a national official electronic bulletin board is expected for this field.
. A quick reference name to refer to the legislation is expected for this field.
. The jurisdiction level (or scope) covered by this legislation.
. One or more articles from this legislation where the criterion is defined and referred to. Beware that the cardinality of this field is multiple.
. Groups codified as ON* must be processed always (e.g. all its elements shown on a GUI or automatically parsed and saved, etc.).
. Pay attention to this type of QUESTION(s). It is intended to act as a *decision point*. If answered with *yes* (INDICATOR value = true) some additional questions will be asked to the economic operator. Thus the value of the code of the next sub-group (set to ONTRUE).
. This property is a QUESTION, therefore a specific type of value will be expected from the economic operator in the ESPD Response (an INDICATOR, i.e. a 'boolean' value true/false, in this case).
. The cbc:ValueDataType indicates the type of value that the buyer requires for this QUESTION. Therefore, in its answer (inside the ESPD Request document) the economic operator will have to use also an INDICATOR value (true/false). Otherwise the mechanism used to validate the ESPD Response should consider the XML instance as invalid (should be treated as a FATAL error).
. Data structures defined by GROW are *re-usable*. This is specially the case (but not uniquely) of the structure 'Is this information available electronically?' Notice that the UUID that identifies this structure is always the same in all the criteria that include it. Similarly structures that are reused in different criteria do have the same UUID (as they are the same). Beware that the group of properties (URI, Reference/Code, Issuer) will only be shown if the answer is 'Yes', thus the sub-group code ONTRUE.

_Note for the future: Cross-border/cross-sector codes_

Some relevant trans-European initiatives, like ECRIS, BRIS, EESSI, have defined Code Lists and other reference data that could be used in e-Procurement generally, and  by the ESPD specifically. This would enhance cross-border and cross-sector semantic and technical interoperability.
For example, in the case of Convictions, a new requirement could be introduced in G1 (see figures above) asking for the ECRIS Code corresponding to the offence that would be specified in the Response where the Economic Operator answered ''yes'' to the first requirement. The ECRIS Codes can be consulted in the Annex to the COUNCIL DECISION 2009/316/JHA of 6 April 2009 on the establishment of the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS) in application of Article 11 of Framework Decision 2009/315/JHA.

. The MS defined this national 'Payment of Taxes' criterion in e-Certis.
. Reference to the EU Legislation. This reusable structure is identical for all the exclusion criteria.
. For this *ESPD Request Payment of Taxes* criterion, the Member State defined in e-Certis a *national REQUIREMENT* consisting in the specification of the '_threshold amount of debt that an economic operator have with the national Tax Agency_' (50 Euros in this example).
. Notice that type of property used is REQUIREMENT. This entails that: a cbc:ValueDataType will be present indicating the type of value the buyer uses for this REQUIREMENT (e.g. AMOUNT, INDICATOR, DESCRIPTION, etc.; see the link:{url-tree}/codelists/gc/ResponseDataType.gc[Code List ResponseDataType], the values are the same for buyers REQUIREMENT(s) than for economic operator response values).
. Beware that No answer is expected here from the economic operator (do not get confused by the presence of the cbc:ValueDataType, as said it is used by both the Buyer and the EO.
. The value supplied by the buyer for this requirement (50 Euros, in this example). Notice that the currency is specified in the attribute currencyID of the cbc:Amount component.
. The MS also allows the buyer the possibility of adding multiple additional textual requirements (in this case the Buyer uses this to explain that ''Beware that the national Tax Agency won't permit the existence of a debt, even if minimal, for two consecutive years'').
. Again, no answer is expected here from the economic operator, as this is a REQUIREMENT issued by the buyer. Hence the element 'cbc:ValueDataTypeCode' contains the type of value of the requirement issued by the buyer.

We have divided the conflict of interest criteria in two groups, this first group is composed of two criteria with the same structure:

* partic-confl: Conflict of interest due to ''direct or indirect involvement in the preparation of this procurement procedure'';
* prep-confl: Conflict of interest due to ''participation in the procurement procedure''.

The second group, named ''Early termination'', is explained in a different section. See section "Early termination).

[NOTE]
====
The UBL specification allows multiple lines of text for the component cbc:Description. This feature can be used to split long descriptions into multiple lines, specially useful when the description contains enumerations.

The data structure for the criterion "Guilty of misrepresentation [...]" below uses the feature to divide four possible cases into different lines. Software and transformation solutions can also use it to generate an XML instance where the enumeration is split in multiple cbc:Description lines.

Other requirements related specifically to purely national criteria are:

[cols=",",]
|===
|*REQUIREMENT* |The Member State must be able to specify in e-Certis individual national criteria, and the economic operator must be able to answer *to each individual purely national exclusion grounds criterion*.
|===

[cols=",",]
|===
|*REQUIREMENT* |For the purely national exclusion grounds that have evidence related in e-Certis, the required evidence should be displayed. When the criterion has no related evidence, the text "No evidence required for this criterion" should be displayed. Per each national criterion the EO needs to be able to provide one or more evidence.
|===

The ESPD-EDM V2.1.1 *Extended ESPD* introduced and important feature: the MS can specify and save in the XML individual national criteria. The mock-ups, data structure and XML example below show how. In the ESPD-EDM, it is kept as the only version of the ESPD is the equivalent to the EXTENDED that was introduced in V2.1.1.

=== Mock-up - economic operator perspective

The figure below shows a fragment of a list of national criteria captured from e-Certis. *Per each criterion* the economic operator must specify whether it fulfils the criterion or not, and if so, provide references to online evidence.
