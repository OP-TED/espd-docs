== Introduction to the ESPD BIS

This BIS is a result of work within ESPDint collaborating with actors
like CEN and DG Grow. The ESPD BIS 41 provides a business oriented
perspective on version 2.1.0 of the ESPD Exchange Data Model and
provides a set of specifications for implementing an ESPD or VCD. The
document is concerned with clarifying requirements for ensuring
interoperability in electronic qualification transactions like the ESPD
and the VCD. It provides guidelines on how to support these requirements
and how to implement the ESPD and VCD in accordance with https://web.archive.org/web/20240225215135/http:/cenbii.eu/deliverables/cen-wsbii-3/cwa-23452015-bii-notification-2/cwa-34562015-bii-tendering-new/[CEN
BII profile 41] and
the https://web.archive.org/web/20240225215135/https:/github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.1.0[ESPD
specifications version 2.1.0] of DG Grow. Both specifications are the
underlying bases for this work. 


The purpose of the BIS 41 is to have an
aggregated list of all concepts that occur in the domain of the ESPD and to provide a syntax bindings for the ESPD request and ESPD
response transactions. The BIS 41 contains all the information elements
of the electronic business transactions exchanged in the qualification
domain by pointing to a given semantic data model for each of the
business transactions. A syntax binding of the semantic data model to
the corresponding UBL 2.2. syntaxes (QualificationApplicationRequest and
QualificationApplicationRequest) used for the EDM v2.1.0 is given.
Additionally, the BIS 41 also lists the business rules (including the
use of code lists and identifiers) that govern and constrain the
execution of business process(es) and its business transactions. Hence,
it shall serve the need for documenting the ESPD concepts and
provide support for developers that are implementing ESPD software
to decide how to represent and collect values for a concept. 

Scope

BIS 41 - European Single Procurement Document (ESPD) describes a process
providing electronic messaging support for requesting and providing an
ESPD. As stated in Art. 59 of the directive 2014/24/EU of the
European Parliament and of the Council, the ESPD is a self-declaration
of a company’s formal status, financial status, abilities and
suitability aimed to streamline and structure online interaction between
Contracting Authorities (CA) and Economic Operators (EO). Economic
Operators no longer have to provide full documentary evidence and
different forms to prove that they fulfil the exclusion and selection
criteria of a tender. Now, companies are able to self-declare these
criteria with a single ESPD form. The actual documents will only have to
be provided by the winner of the tender. The ESPD allows buyers and suppliers to handle
the entire qualification processes in public tenders electronically. 

Goals

The main business benefits to be gained by implementing this profile
are:

[width="100%",cols="8%,92%",options="header",]
|===
|ID* |Description*
|G41-001 |The ESPD allows the contracting body to install a systematic
qualification process, with considerable simplification for the benefit
of both contracting authorities and economic operators.

|G41-002 |Economic operators can automatically generate an ESPD with the
support of an ESPD service according to the criteria set out in a call
for tender.

|G41-003 |Main contractors can easily request subcontractors or partner
contractors in consortia to provide their ESPDs.

|G41-004 |The ESPD allows for a semi-automated and simple process to
prove qualification of economic operators in tendering procedures
through self-declarations.

*_Table 1: Goals_*


Business environment

*Introduction*

The intended scope for this profile includes public procurement, but the
profile may also be used in Business to Business (B2B) relations. +
This profile is intended to support transmission of electronic documents
for processing in (semi-)automated processes. The legal requirements
that were taken into account are requirements from European legislation,
in particular the EU directives, mentioned in section 5 of this
profile. +
The transactions, specified in this profile are intended to be exchanged
between the tendering systems of economic operators and contracting
bodies. This means that it is expected that the parties have connected
their systems to the internet, and that they have middleware in place to
enable them to send and receive the transactions in a secure way, using
an agreed syntax. +
The content model of the transactions can also be used in procurement
platforms or portals, so that these platforms as well as procurement
systems of economic operators and contracting bodies are based on the
same information and process models, which makes them more
interoperable. Even if platforms are not technically interoperable, the
content model facilitates understanding the tendering documents and to
participate in the tendering process.

*Tendering procedures*

Individual pre-award processes can be put in place using different
procedures, depending on the value and the type of the contract to be
awarded, on the legal nature of the contracting body and on specific
member state national legislation (Directive 2014/24/EU art. 26). In
open procedures, any economic operator can access the tender documents
(including the call for tenders) and submit a tender before the time
expires, without subscribing for interest and without any previous
assessment of their capabilities. In restricted and negotiated
procedures and in a competitive dialogue the interested economic
operators must submit a request to participate in order to be invited to the tendering process by the contracting body. When the contracting body
has published a notice, the interested economic operators may subscribe
to obtain tendering information using profile #BII46#. Negotiated
procedures require sending the invitation to tender (profile #BII52#) to
identified candidates. +
Article 26 to 32 from Directive 2014/24/EU and article 43 to 50 from
Directive 2014/25/EU describe the different tendering procedures that
can be used by contracting bodies. For the purpose of electronic
tendering, some of these procedures have been described in BII profiles
BII37 (open procedure) and BII39 (restricted procedure). These profiles
are included
in https://web.archive.org/web/20240225215135/http:/cenbii.eu/deliverables/cen-wsbii-3/cwa-23452015-bii-notification-2/cwa-34562015-bii-tendering-new/[CWA
3456] parts 106 and 108. +
Official notification through publishing bodies is part of many
procedures. eNotification covers the electronic transfer of electronic
notices for publication and dissemination services with the ultimate aim
of opening market opportunities. Profiles BII14 Prior Information
Notice, BII10 Contract Notice and BII43 Contract Award Notice describe
the exchange of a notice between a contracting body or his
representative and a publisher. Profile BII61 describes the exchange of
notices between publishers. The process by which notices can be searched
for on a given platform are described in profiles BII62 Exchange of
Notice Metadata and BII45 Search Notices. These profiles are included
in https://web.archive.org/web/20240225215135/http:/cenbii.eu/deliverables/cen-wsbii-3/cwa-23452015-bii-notification-2/[CWA

*_Table 2: High Level Business Requirements_*

== Key Examples

=== Example 1

A contracting body from Germany using the eTendering platform e-Vergabe
starts to prepare a tendering procedure, because it wants to buy goods
from any European supplier. First, it starts to prepare the relevant
documents in particular the tender notice and call for tender in any
local format (e.g. x-Vergabe9. As part of this process, the contracting
body specifies the qualification criteria in the form of a structured
ESPD Template, according to pre-defined codes, which need to be proven
by economic operators applying for the contract. The contracting body
adds the standardised qualification criteria to the tender notice and/or
call for tender, or it includes the ESPD Template as an attachment to
the previous. +
After having searched for interesting call for tenders across Europe,
having received an invitation to the call for tender, or having received
a notification from a platform where the economic operator is subscribed
to (e.g. TED), an economic operator from the Netherlands subscribed
interest (using TenderNed as his or her tendering platform to prepare
the bid) and received the tender documents, including qualification
criteria. In this ESPD profile, the most relevant document received is
the call for tender including the list of qualification criteria (as part
of the call for tender itself or as attached ESPD Template). The list of
qualification criteria is received in a standardized, structured format.
Besides preparing the content of the tender in the tendering platform
(e.g. TenderNed), the economic operator opens the ESPD Template received
and creates the standardized form confirming that he/she fulfils all
qualification criteria. The economic operator inserts the finalized ESPD
in the Tender Offer and submits it together with the offer to e-Vergabe
(using TenderNed as his/her client). The contracting body receives the
offer in e-Vergabe, including the ESPD.

=== Example 2

Along the procedure described in Example 1, the economic operator is not
a single tenderer. He / she bids in a consortium and has a subcontractor
him- or herself. Hence, the economic operator as main contractor sends a
request from his TenderNed client to the German subcontractor to provide
the ESPD for the tender. The German subcontractor receives the request
via DE-Mail. Furthermore, the economic operator sends a request from his
TenderNed client to the Austrian, Italian and Greek partner contractors
via eDelivery channels to provide their ESPDs for the tender.  +
The German subcontractor, being located in Berlin, logs in to the ESPD
service provider portal of Auftragsberatungsstelle Brandenburg e.V. He
uploads the ESPD template received, fills and signs the ESPD using the
ESPD service there, and retrieves the filled and signed ESPD from the
portal via download. Afterwards, he sends the ESPD to the main
contractor's tendering client (TenderNed) via DE-Mail.  +
The Austrian partner contractor contacts ANKÖ to generate the ESPD. He
uploads the ESPD template received, fills and signs the ESPD using the
ANKÖ ESPD service, and sends from ANKÖ's portal the ESPD to the
TenderNed client of the main contractor. +
The Italian economic operator uses the ESPD service of the European
Commission (DG-GROW) to generate the ESPD. He uploads the ESPD template
to the portal and fills the data. Then he retrieves the filled ESPD and
sends it via eDelivery to the Dutch main contractor. +
The Greek economic operator uses the Greek ESPD service which works
similar to the German one as described before. To deliver the ESPD to
the Dutch economic operator, he uses the eSens eDelivery service. +
Finally, the Dutch economic operator adds all received ESPDs to the bid
in the bidder client of TenderNed and submits the bid using eSubmission
profiles of BII, where the ESPDs of all consortium members and
subcontractors are included as attachment.

=== Example 3

The scope of the scenario is a combination of example 1 and example 2.
However, the contracting body uses a two-stage procedure. The
contracting body makes the same preparations as described in 3.2.1,
except that the procedure is different.  +
The economic operator, as in example 1, subscribes to the procedure and
receives the ESPD template. As it is a two-stage procedure, only the
submission of the ESPD is required. Accordingly, he requests ESPDs of
his consortium partners and subcontractors, and uses TenderNed to fill
in his own ESPD – see the details described in example 2. Finally, the
economic operator as main contractor submits the package of ESPDs from
his TenderNed client via eDelivery to e-Vergabe.

=== Implementation Guideline: ESPD request transaction (Trdm070)

This guideline explains how to use
the https://web.archive.org/web/20240225215135/http:/docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-2.2.html[UBL
2.2 syntax or the QualificationApplicationRequest] to
implement https://web.archive.org/web/20240225215135/https:/github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.1.0[ESPD-EDM
version 2.1.0] to support the CEN BII information transaction
requirements. It provides the syntax mappings from the UBL syntax to the
ESPD request transaction (Trdm070). It also provides specific details
for each class and information element and provides guidelines, rules
and examples on how to produce conformant XML documents. Additionally,

Code Lists

A number of information elements values are constrained (or should be
constrained) to be those in a list of codes known as Code Lists; the
specific Code Lists used in business transactions must be common between
business partners in order to achieve interoperability. The following
table lists the code lists identified by eSENS to be used in this eSENS
BIS. The dictionary entry name identifies the name of the element which
needs to consider the codes according to this BIS and the ESPD
domain vocabulary
(https://web.archive.org/web/20240225215135/https:/wiki.ds.unipi.gr/download/attachments/56919072/ESPD%20EDM%20%20v202%20DomainVocabulary.xlsx?version=1&modificationDate=1543573750000&api=v2[excel
file] (TO BE UPDATED)). For each code list a corresponding issuer agency
is identified including a hyperlink to the source. While the listId
uniquely identifies the code list, the genericode files can be used for
the implementation.

Identifiers

eSENS has to define a policy for the use of identifiers that describes
the specific case for Party Identifiers and principles that should be
followed cases when eSENS transport infrastructures is used. As the ESPD
not necessarily needs to apply these rules the policy for the use of
identifiers is not mandatory but an optional element for the ESPD
implementation. About the specific use of identifiers this BIS states as
follows.

[width="100%",cols="28%,72%",options="header",]

BE UPDATED?)

|Legislation. Identifier |Compulsory use of schemeAgencyID attribute. If
a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) exists for this legislation please use
it here.

|TenderingCriterionProperty. Identifier |Requirement identifiers must
use UUID numbers (version 4) automatically generated. The responses of
the economic operator (in the ESPD Response document) will refer to this
UUID to link the response with one, and only one, criterion property.
Requirements which are added manually should also use UUID version 4. 
Compulsory use of schemeAgencyID attribute

|Document Reference. Identifier (Evidence) |If the reference or
verification code is provided for the evidence use this element to place
it. This 'code' is used in some countries (e.g. Spain) to check that the
document is authentic. If a verification code is supplied you can use an
official 'end-point' to retrieve an image (or a PDF) of the document and
check that the evidence is authentic. Compulsory use of schemeAgencyID
attribute

|Procurement Project Lot. Identifier |Compulsory use of schemeAgencyID
attribute. Use the value "0" to indicate that this procurement project
has no lots.

|Document Reference. Identifier |Reference number of the Contract Notice
in TeD MUST be specified using the follow scheme defined by the
Publications Office: [][][][]/S [][][]-[][][][][][] (e.g. 2015/S
252-461137). Compulsory use of schemeAgencyID attribute

|Party. Endpoint Identifier. Identifier |Compulsory use of
schemeAgencyID attribute. An endpoint identifier may have a scheme
identifier attribute (e.g. eSENS Party Identifier Scheme) for eDelivery.
Otherwise, use it for online services (e.g. Web Services, REST services,
ftp, etc.)

|Party Identification. Identifier |More than one identifier can be
specified. Compulsory use of the attribute schemeAgencyID and highly
recommended the use of the attribute schemeAgencyID. The preferred
identifier is the national VAT number.  

|Service Provider Party. Party Identification. Identifier |Compulsory
use of schemeAgencyID attribute. In many countries this ID is the VAT
number, but in the future it could be the European Unique ID provided by
the Business Registers Interconnection System (BRIS).

|Qualification Application Request. Customization Identifier |Compulsory
use of the value “urn:www.cenbii.eu:transaction:biitrdm070:ver3.0” and
the value “CEN-BII " for the “schemeAgencyID”

|Qualification Application Response. Customization Identifier
|Compulsory use of value
“urn:www.cenbii.eu:transaction:biitrdm092:ver3.0” and the value “CEN-BII
" for the “schemeAgencyID”

*_Table 12: Identifiers_*

Business Rules

In order to facilitate interoperability in cross border trade, sets of
business rules should been defined. +
The business rules are sets of rules that clarify the content of
instances by stating mandatory fields, fixed values (like code lists),
dependency between fields in the same object and dependency between
different objects. The business rules are grouped into two main sections
depending on their scope :

* rules working on a single object (i.e.: an ESPD Request XML document
or an ESPD XML document);
** check mandatory fields, fixed values and dependencies between fields;
** check the use of mandatory set of values on specific fields (code
lists);
* rules working on more than one object (e.g. an XML document and an
ASIC Container):
** check information constraints (e.g. file reference checks) including
" Multidimensional" checks crossing the barrier between different
objects, i.e. metadata versus physical object instances, or
"Cross-referencing" checks between the content value.

Each rule has an error level that can be stated as:

* _warning_: offering recommendations to improve the quality of the
instance or regain full validity
* _fatal_: the rule point to a major issue of consistency or data
correctness.

The table below collects a set of business rules coming affecting the
creation of instances. The terms used in the business rules refer to the
corresponding schema elements. The list is an indicative list and will
be extended and approved in future versions of this document. MUST rules
correspond to an error level that can be stated as _fatal_, while SHOULD
rules correspond to an error level that can be stated as _warning_.

*Common Business Rules*

The Common Business Rules are designed for both ESPD Request and
Response and reflect the general rules applied to the creation and
processing of any ESPD document.

Criteria Data Structures

The contracting body shall provide the exclusion grounds and selection
criteria for its tendering process as structured information.The
ESPD-EDM which is based on UBL 2.2 defines a flexible structure to
express data about criteria and possible responses. The data elements
provided by UBL-2.2  can be used to implement XML documents with
different criteria structures. Such nesting of criteria, groups of
requirements and requirements can end up in complex XML instances which
are a barrier for the (semantic) interoperability between systems.
Hence, the need of establishing of a minimum set of rules about how to
build up such criteria data structures is required.  Version 2.1.0 of
the ESPD establishes fixed criteria data structures which are based on
the requirements expressed in
the https://web.archive.org/web/20240225215135/http:/eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0007[Annex
to the Regulation 2016/7]. The required criteria structures are
therefore outlined in sections "IV. Criteria, common aspects" and "V.
Exclusion criteria" and "VI. Selection criteria" of
the https://web.archive.org/web/20240225215135/https:/espd.github.io/ESPD-EDM/v2.0.2/[ESPD
XML Implementation Guide v2.0.2] (TO BE UPDATED). 

The answering of questions related to these criteria structures is
further explained in section "VII.7 Answering QUESTIONs". 

An comprehensive specification of the used criteria data structures is
additionally provided in
the https://web.archive.org/web/20240225215135/https:/github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.1.0/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/xlsx[ESPD
Data Structure spreadsheets]. Among other things, the spreadsheet was
used as a prototype tool to generate the XML instances of the criteria
data structures used in the ESPD Request and ESDP Response
documents. The meta concepts used in the ESDP-EDM Spreadsheet
vocabulary therefore had to be mapped to the UBL-2.2 vocabulary. The
table below shows the mapping between both vocabularies and therewith
provides an inital understanding for how to implement valid criteria
data structures.

*_Table 15: Mapping between the ESPD-EDM criterion data structure

Note: This fixed criteria data structure outlined above imposes
limitations to the maintainability and evolution of the ESPD. A
dynamic approach where the criteria data structures can be retrieved
through an interface based on the data available
in https://web.archive.org/web/20240225215135/https:/ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/ecertis/[e-Certis] is
currently being addressed by the European Commission in order to
overcome these limitations. As long as there is no reliable e-Certis
system available which establishes these rules for criteria data
structures, this BIS is therefore referencing to the specifications
described above.
